Do we want the screen to show exact lattice values, or some kind of time-average or intensity value?
    If they show exact lattice values (both + and -), then the screen is always changing (may be confusing, hard to read, hard to interpret).
What to do about negative curve values on the screen being hidden behind the wave area?

When zooming in on particles, we want to keep the wavelength constant, so maybe should call this "magnify particles"
    Alternatively, when zooming in, we could increase the wavelength, but this leads to problems with resizing the lattice.  Maybe better to keep the wavelength the same on zoom in and call the operation "magnify particles"?
We want to show the initial transient in the wave starting up (say, for photons), but don't want all of space to already be the photon color.  How to handle this?  Black or White screen as default?  Then what are minima for the waves (could artificially increase the wavelength by a factor of 2 to make it look the same).
What is fringe view vs wave view for the screen?  Is this showing the outline of the waveform (ie lineplot whose height is a function of intensity at that location) vs showing vertical stripes, the brightness being a function of intensity?
What is better for rotation graphic: isometric or extended?

?	The graph that shows the efield should have the arrows colored the same as the curve and possibly a place to choose vectors on or off but hard to say until we see the graph.
Not easy (yet) to make the view angle box narrower.

?	Detectors should have red x’s in the upper right corner to delete them.
>Did you mean Barriers?

All three views will rotate (Sound and Light show same thing on side as on top)

o Intensity readers should be constrained on the x-axis when in side-view.
>>This sounds like a lot of work.  Let's just disable them instead.

Is it possible to get some sort of switch or button as the on off's for each
panel?
>>I think the "on" "off" checkboxes we have now is very clear, and looks good.
>>Let's become more strongly motivated before changing this, and also have something
>>extremely concrete that we're sure will work.

o Graphs need to be cropped.
>>Should graphs really be cropped?  Is this just for visual appeal?
>>We are discarding this comment because it may be better without.

* Dark wave should propagate through barrier because otherwise for a solid barrier, the light will never disappear.

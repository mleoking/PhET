<h2>Absorption and Emission</h2>

<p>
    This applet models the interaction between electrons (shown as blue dots) and photons (red squiggles). Four
    processes are modelled: absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and pumping; the frequency of
    occurrence of these processes may be set using the text fields provided.

    <table border=1>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <applet archive="classes.jar" code="EmissionApplet" width=750 height=400>
                </applet>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p>
    The absorption rate is the probability that a photon will be absorbed by any one electron; similarly for the
    stimulated emission rate. The other two rates, for spontaneous emission and pumping are the probability per time
    interval <i>T</i> of those events occurring, where <i>T</i> is the time taken for a photon to travel from one side
    of the display to the other.

<p>
    The population inversion (proportion of electrons at the upper level) is displayed in the top corner of the applet.
    Using the &quot;inversion&quot; field, this value may be set. When the &quot;apply inversion&quot; button is
    clicked, the electrons will be randomly distributed according to the specified inversion.

<p>
    In addition, an inversion of 0 or 1 may be set using the &quot;none excited&quot; or &quot;all excited&quot;
    buttons.

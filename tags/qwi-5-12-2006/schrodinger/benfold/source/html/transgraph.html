<h2>Transmission and Reflection</h2>

This applet graphs transmission and reflection against energy, for a series of potential barriers. The potential
function is shown on the left-hand side of the applet; the height, width, period and number of barriers can be adjusted
using the fields provided.
<p>
    The right-hand graph shows reflection and transmission (either or both may be plotted) versus energy. The range of
    energy values plotted can also be chosen.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The potential graph will only display a few barriers; the purpose is simply to represent the shape of the
        function
    <li>Switching between plotting transmission/reflection/both does not require a significant delay; changing other
        parameters will result in a calculation delay proportional to the number of barriers
    <li>To cancel a calculation, click the graph
    <li>The controls will be disabled during longer calculations
</ul>

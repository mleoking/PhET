<h2>Overview of important classes</h2>

<p>

<h3>Plotter, Plotter2, RotatedPlotter</h3>
The <a href="docs/Plotter.html">Plotter</a> class (and its two variants) are responsible for painting graphs on the
screen. The whole graph can be painted with a single method invocation, or individual components (scale, axes, etc.) can
be drawn separately. It is generally best to have one plotter per data set; if they are to plotted on top of one
another, the scale and axes of one plotter can be disabled to reduce drawing time (and potential for unsightly visual
artifacts).

<p>

<h3>Solvable</h3>
The data to be plotted is provided by a <a href="docs/Solvable.html">Solvable object</a>; implementation of this
interface requires implementation of a solve() method, which should fill an array with solution data.
<p>
    This approach is faster than requesting individual values (simply because the method invocation overheads are
    removed); it is more flexible too. This approach does not force each value to be independent; the <i>(i+1)</i>th
    value can depend on the <i>i</i>th value if necessary. There is no requirement that the mechanism behind this method
    should resemble a function; the <a href="docs/Histogram.html">Histogram</a> and <a href="docs/TimeGraph.html">TimeGraph</a>
    classes are examples of this.

<p>
    <a href="docs/SolnCache.html">SolnCache</a> is an example of a Solvable object which does no work for itself; an
    instance of this class will be initialised with a &quot;slave&quot; Solvable, which it will use to fill a cache of
    solution data.

<p>

<h3>Function</h3>
As a rule, any object which behaves like a function could implement the <a href="docs/Function.html">Function</a>
interface. To create a Solvable from a Function, use the <a href="docs/SolvFunction.html">SolvFunction</a> class.

<p>

<h3>BaseApplet</h3>
<a href="docs/BaseApplet.html">BaseApplet</a> is the common superclass for all of these applets. Implements buffered
painting to remove flicker effects and reduce repainting costs. Also reads in some standard parameters for setting font
face and size, enabling buffering, and enabling extra safety checks.

<p>

<h3>BaseApplet2</h3>
All the applets, bar <a href="docs/LatticeApplet.html">LatticeApplet</a> are derived from <a
        href="docs/BaseApplet2.html">BaseApplet2</a>, itself derived from BaseApplet. As the name suggests, this is an
extended version of BaseApplet. This class automatically creates a panel at the base of the applet to hold GUI
components, and redirects calls to add() and setLayout() to this panel. Helper methods are provided to combine common
operations; a text field with a label may be created, added to the panel, registered with the applet (so that events may
be received), and added to a list of controls, all in one method invocation. As a list of controls is kept by this
class, it is possible to enable or disable every control simultaneously with a single method invocation.

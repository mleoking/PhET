These country flags are public domain images gotten from
   http://i.hbtronix.de/index.php?t=flags&display=&start=all

See 'include/locale-codes-country.php' for current code to
country name mapping.

At the time of this writing, all supported country codes are present except
for AQ.png (Antarctica), which has no official flag.

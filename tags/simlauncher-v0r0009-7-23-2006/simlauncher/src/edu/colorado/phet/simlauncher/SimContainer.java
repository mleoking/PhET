 * This interface is provided so that menu items and actions can determine what Simulation
 * to deal with at event-time. Some such event responders must be created when a Swing
 * control is created, but before that control knows what Simulation a particular event
 * refers to. This is the case, for example, with lists and tables. Other examples are menu
 * items that are used in both global and context menus.
 * <p/>
 * Simulation itself implements this interface, so that all Swing control that work with
 * Simulations can have uniform constructors

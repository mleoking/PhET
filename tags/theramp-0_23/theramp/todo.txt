If the block is grabbed to start recording, the cursor from playback doesn’t disappear.

Add child/sled.
Fix or delete FBD.

When time is up, readouts should disappear, and should say "recording complete"
I’ve changed it so the readouts always reflect the block state (even if recording time is completed.)  Do we still want a “recording complete” message?  I like leaving the readouts on—it seems more intuitive.

FBD is hard to get to, disappears if you hit play.
FBD vectors are often too large for the window.

Low Priority:
18. Reduce the total record time?  Slow time down?
This was supposed to address the problem of low horizontal real estate.  I'm not sure how well it succeeds.
30. Make slider thumb more three-d-er.
31. Move “frictionless” checkbox inside slider area (2nd panel only).
·	Striped Arrow coordinate view stripes for perp & parallel?
o	My technique will be difficult for perp & parallel.  We shall confer about the Cartesian arrow graphics before pursuing.

Plum Pudding model:

- does it absorp all wavelengths with equal probability?
yes

- is probability of absorption 50% ?
make it changable 1:n chance

- is #photons emitted related to #photons absorbed?
yes. can absorb only one.

- how often are photons emitted?
after some random time period

- is wavelength of emitted photons always 150 nm (UV) ?
yes

- when does electron start/stop oscillation? is it related to #photons absorbed and emitted?
starts oscillating when it absorbs first photon.
stops after emitting photon.

- is the initial position of the electron random along its oscillation line?
near center of oscillation line

Solar System model:

- what is V in E=V^2 for energy diagram?
E=-V^2, 0 is at top of diagram

- does electron start off the top of the energy diagram?
start at top (at zero)

- does electron drop off the bottom of the energy diagram?
yep

- kaboom graphic is not an animation. should it stay on-screen until atom is reset?
yes

- does kaboom graphic give the (wrong) impression that there is a smoke-&-fire explosion?
there is an explosion


Ionized dialogs:

- behavior described in design doc does not work with model selection behavior

same as destroyed dialog behavior

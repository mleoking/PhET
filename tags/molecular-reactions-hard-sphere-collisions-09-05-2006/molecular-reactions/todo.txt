Bugs
====
- Amount of energy needed to get to reaction is delta from floor, not absolute value
- Should kinetic energy increase if compound molecule has lower floor?
- How should selection/higlighting work? Use CM instead of halo.
- Composite molecules should have specified space between the components

- Reason why nearestToTrackedMolecule gets lost when it becomes part of a composit molecule:
    It is taken out of the model while it's part of the composite molecule!

==========
Internal
==========
- HardBodyCollision takes Molecules. It should take Body
- Look at todo in CompositeMolecule.releaseSimpleMolecule()

==============
Model features
==============
- MoleculeMoleculeCollisionAgent.createBond() is bad. It always uses the same molecule in the composite to bond to.

===============
Model questions
===============
- When a reaction occurs, should the new component molecule snap into place where the one it knocked off  was?
- How much kinetic energy should the component that was knocked off have?

<h2>Lattice Vectors</h2>

<p>
    A two-dimensional lattice can be described completely by two vectors. The applet displays two vectors and the
    lattice they generate (using a hexagon as the basis). These two vectors may be dragged using the mouse, and the
    lattice will update accordingly.

    <table border=1>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <applet archive="classes.jar" code="LatticeApplet" width=500 height=400>
                </applet>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
    The two vectors should be linearly independent. If <b>a</b> = <i>k</i><b>b</b> (for some real number <i>k</i>), then
    all the points in the lattice lie on a straight line.

<p>
    If the two vectors are <i>almost</i> dependent (ie. the angle between them is very small), then the lattice will be
    very dense. In such cases, the applet will draw no more than approximately 3700 instances of the basis.

Bug: Babinet's principle is not satisfied by this simulation.

Disable detectors when inverse slits are on.

Bug: in Single Particle, with a detector on each slit, sometimes both detectors fire simultaneously and the particle disappears.  Hard to reproduce this reliably.

Detector norm seems off.  If I make detector very large so that it covers the entire box, it only registers 80-95%, rather than 100% as I would expect since the entire particle is inside it.

Bug: sometimes the cursor gets stuck with the double-headed resize arrow.

There is an abnormally bright region just beneath the slits in intensity mode with detector(s) on.
___
Add mass to the schrodinger equation.

When I change the vertical position of the slits, the detector moves first, and then the slits.  Can you make them both move together?

Allow user to move slit barrier up and down by clicking on it and dragging. (low priority).

When I move the vertical position of the slits, the response is very jerky and discontinuous.  Can this be any smoother?

The controls should look more fun.  (The controls on Ron’s new Photoelectric simulation might be a good model.)

Bug: If I check and uncheck “slit absorption” with no slits and no barriers, it creates little glitches in the beam.

The “slit absorption” checkbox should have no effect if there are no slits or barriers.

From Interviews___
fix range of sliders to keep the physics in a meaningful range

Rename "absorbing slits" to "absorbing barriers"

Rename the "save" button to ???.

Remove the “double slit” option from the 2-laser panel.

better way of representing a disabled detector

Detect Now! button shouldn't disable detectors

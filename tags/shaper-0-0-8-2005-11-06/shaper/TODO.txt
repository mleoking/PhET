"To Do" list for "Optical Pulse Shaper" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:


HIGH PRIORITY:
- investigate why it's harder to match by systematically moving each slider

MEDIUM PRIORITY:


LOW PRIORITY:
- separate the molecule model & view
- FourierSumPlot should observe its FourierSeries


NEW FEATURES:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setIgnoreMouse


CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors


PHETCOMMON:
- clip should be in specifiable in local coordinate, but it currently needs to be in global coordinates

Design decisions:

Chart.java is 480 lines with 5 inner classes, 205 lines without these classes.

Here are these inner classes:
*GridLineSet
*Axis
Grid
AbstractGrid
AxisGrid


The client should know about those marked with a *.

So I will move those to upper level, as public classes, and the others to upper level as package-protected classes.
We can change this at any time.

Aspect ratio?

Ensure Axis is not painted when not in chart Range.

Support for buffering the chart (and only drawing incremental changes)?

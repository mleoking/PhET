===========================================================================

This folder contains the Schmidt-Lee applet from
http://fermi.la.asu.edu/Schroedinger/index.html
This applet is a "visualizer-solver for the one-dimensional Schrodinger Equation".
See COPYRIGHT.txt for the author's original copyright statement.


ABOUT THE JAR FILE...
---------------------
I packaged this applet into a double-click JAR file so that
it can be run as a standalone application.  When run from a web browser
as an applet, the Read/Write features don't work because of Java security issues.


ABOUT THE TXT FILES...
----------------------
The .txt files can be read into the Schmidt-Lee applet, and are 
useful for comparing behavior with our Bound States simulation.
There are 1-well files for each of the Bound States well types.
There are 2-well files for Coulomb and Square wells.
The parameters to V(x) in each file are as follows:
offset = offset
d = depth
w = width
s = spacing (separation for square wells)

Mass is assumed to be 1 x electron mass (5.68).

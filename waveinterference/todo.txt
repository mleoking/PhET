Evaluate the different lattice shape on the light tab.  Should all modules use this shape?

Increase performance on mac.

There is one detail that I just noticed. I think the stopwatch in the sound
tab needs to be recalibrated. With the sound on, the range of freq appears
to be ~100-5000Hz. If you run the stop watch and measure the freq of the
speaker movement, it looks like the actual freq of the speaker is about
1000x too low.

Solution: If you change the stopwatch to read microsec, I think this should
make everything consistent.

Questions
##################################

Right now single sources can move horizontally and pairs can move vertically (independently).
Implementing constrained dragging for pairs (i.e. dragging the top one brings the bottom one closer
to the midline as well) would be disproportionately more difficult.

Movable sources for sound and light don't seem as important as they are for
water.  If it can be done with a minimal amount of work then I'd suggest
doing the same things that you've done with the faucets.
>>This would not be too much work, but maybe we should avoid it unless it will be useful to the users.

I implemented dragging for the faucets, should I also do this for other wave sources?
There are a lot of things in this sim that are not obvious, like the fact
that you can drag the faucets and barriers. Do we need some sort of cue that you can move
things? Or should we wait and see?

Should wave sources be draggable in all directions?
>>Interview First

Movable
faucets are really cool but before you make them move side to side in two
drip mode, let's interview.  Sounds like it'd be a lot of work.
>>Not a lot of work, just thought this constraint might be more user-friendly.

o Test at 1024x768
>>Things get ugly when minimizing the window beyond a certain extent.
>>I'll Reduce the wavelength/amplitude controls when window shrinks; hopefully this
>>(or this + other small modifications) is sufficient

Reduce the wavelength/amplitude controls when window shrinks.
>>I'm not convinced this single change will sufficiently improve the resizing of the program. (maybe at 1024x768)?

What help items do we want?

Do we want/need a wiggle me?  Should the simulation come up running?

8. Potential Help items (wait for student interviews): maybe for drag faucets, only rotate when symmetric.

Low Priority

- It looks like the particles run away from the speaker and then fill in
from behind. I know this is sort of an optical illusion, but there may be a
way to minimize this visual effect. I tried to follow a single particle and
it still looked like it was running away.

Do we want to optionally show absolute values (or intensities) in the wave area
(to give a more global idea of constructive and destructive interference)?
o I would leave it up to others whether we should show intensity in the wave
itself. I don't really have an opinion, but I would lean towards not doing
this, since there are already a lot of controls in this sim and I'm not sure
what this option would buy us. Maybe in an advanced pull-down menu??
>>This looks like it wouldn't be a useful feature.  I'll drop it for now.

Pressure waves are out of phase (particles are too slow to keep up with pressure).
- I did notice that - I was going to mention that high pressure should be
where the particles are dense. Right now it looks 180 deg. out of phase.
>>I switched the phase by 180 degrees, still slightly off, but maybe good enough?

o Right now audio is implemented to play the audio directly at the speaker (not a distance from the speaker.)
Should we add 'listener' mode, as in 'sound waves' simulation?
    >>not now.

I noticed that when the graph is on, there is a dotted line across the pool.
I like that. Maybe the edge of the rotating box should also be dotted? I
mean the edge that is the same as where the dotted line appears (which is
also the axis of rotation). I suppose if the top and sides of the box are
polygons that might be hard to do.

Last thing. Is it possible to make the dotted line appear when you click on
the view angle slider? What I envision is that you click on the slider and
the dotted line appears on the pool, stays dotted as the edge of the
rotating box, and disappears when you release the slider. Just an idea, but
I wouldn't spend any time on it for now. Just wondering if it is possible.

What should be done with the faucet graphics when in side view with 2 faucets?
>> Leave them alone (too much work.)

On units: the units on the graph and tape look fine. The units for slit
parameters and source spacing should match (or else there should be no units
on these).
>>I've disabled these readouts (to avoid the work), might not be too hard,
but this also cleans up the control panel a bit.

Bug: The screen chart's intensity crops in an awkward fashion (at about 0.9?)
>>This is because the screen is reading the values from the color graph directly
(not from the wave data).  Rather than redirect the information source,
I've just scaled the data higher so it looks like it should crop there.

>>Bug: Light Module's screen can run off the screen (under the control panel) for awkward window sizes (& languages with longer text)

Could add type-in text fields with correct units in control panel (needs some work due to proper units).

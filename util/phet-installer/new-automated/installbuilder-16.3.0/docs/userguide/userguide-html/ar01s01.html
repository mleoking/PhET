It is designed to simplify the deployment
of both desktop and server software, helping you reduce support costs related to installation and provide a positive
end-user experience.</p><p>This document provides an overview of InstallBuilder capabilities and architecture, as well as in-depth coverage of common
installation topics. A companion appendix provides detailed information on each one of the XML configuration options.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_what_sets_installbuilder_apart"></a>1.1. What Sets InstallBuilder Apart</h3></div></div></div><p>To fully understand the architecture and capabilities of InstallBuilder, it is useful to consider the previous generation of
cross-platform installers. These were built using the Java programming language. Java is a fine choice for multiple
scenarios and indeed over half of your users use InstallBuilder to package Java-based applications. However, it has a set of
major drawbacks when the goal is to create setup programs. For example, it requires a Java runtime environment to be present in the
machine, which increases the chances of something going wrong if one is not present or the one present is not a suitable version.
Alternatively, if the user decides to bundle a JRE with the installer in order to avoid these potential problems, it will increase
significantly the footprint of the installation.  Java-based installers also require a self-extraction step, in which the
files are first unpacked to disk before installation can begin. For large installers, this can be a time-consuming step and
another source of installation-related issues if the end-user runs out of disk space during this process. Finally, and
although alternative toolkits like SWT finally emerged, Java GUI development has traditionally suffered from poor
performance and lack of a truly native look-and-feel. End-users react much more favorably to setup applications that are responsive
and provide a familiar <span class="emphasis"><em>native</em></span> interface, even if the functionality is identical.</p><p>The above is not intended as a rant against Java-based installers, rather as an illustration of the challenges that a cross
platform installation tool faces. So, how does InstallBuilder address these issues? Installers generated with
InstallBuilder are native applications that do not require any runtime to be present in the system to run. This means that the overhead the
installer introduces is very small, typically around 2 to 3 Mb, versus the 15 Mb to 20 Mb that a bundled JRE requires. In
addition to this, the installers do not perform a self-extraction step, meaning that they start up instantaneously, whereas
some Java-based installers can take up to minutes to initialize for large installers. Installers created with InstallBuilder use the
underlying system libraries for displaying their GUI interfaces, so users get a native look and feel for
each platform the installers run on, such as Windows and Mac OS X. On Linux and other Unix platforms, there is not a single
<span class="emphasis"><em>standard</em></span> look and feel. In those cases, InstallBuilder provides a choice between the most common toolkits, Qt and GTK, as
well as a built-in fallback mode.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_what_8217_s_new_in_installbuilder_15"></a>1.2. What’s New In InstallBuilder 15</h3></div></div></div><p>InstallBuilder 15 provides a host of new features, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

This is particularly useful for situations in which you need to build the installers as part of a continuous integration/daily build scenario.</p><p>The GUI installer design tool helps you to visually create installation projects. The GUI design tool runs on Linux x86/x64, OS X and Windows with a minimum of 800x600 screen resolution.

The GUI is only available on Linux x86/x64, Windows and OS X.</p><p>Once the GUI is launched, you will be welcomed with the screen displayed in Figure 1. From this main screen you can use the top menu entries to create a new project or open an existing one, launch the build process, check for an updated version of InstallBuilder, register your copy of the tool and open the documentation.</p><div class="figure"><a id="idm140427935419616"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1. GUI welcome screen</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/gui-noproject.png" align="middle" alt="GUI welcome screen" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>Alternatively, you can use the shortcut buttons to perform the most common actions:</p><div class="figure"><a id="idm140427935416336"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2. GUI Toolbar</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/toolbar.png" align="middle" alt="GUI Toolbar" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>Some of the toolbar buttons will be disabled depending on whether a project is loaded or not. Figure 2 also shows the notification you
will see when a new version is available. If the builder has access to the Internet and is configured to check for updates, it will automatically report
these notifications for each new version released. The process can also be manually triggered using the <code class="literal">Update</code> menu. Clicking on the blue arrow will open
the downloads page in a web browser.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><table border="0" summary="Note: Disabling checking for new versions of InstallBuilder"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/icons/note.png" /></td><th align="left">Disabling checking for new versions of InstallBuilder</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>If you do not want the installer to check for updates on startup, you can edit the <code class="literal">update.dat</code> file located in the same directory as the builder and set <code class="literal">check_for_updates=0</code></p></td></tr></table></div><p>After loading or creating a new project, a new UI will appear, divided in different sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

It is always possible to override these default values when necessary.</p><p>Enabling <code class="literal">Save Relative Paths</code> will convert all of the absolute paths related to the build process (files to pack, images, readme…) to relative paths, using the location of the project file as the reference. This setting will be applied automatically and transparently when saving and loading the project so it will not be noticeable while working in the GUI. This particular setting is especially useful when sharing a project between developers or operating systems, as the location of the resources is not hardcoded, as explained in the<a class="link" href="ar01s02.html#when_to_use_save_relative_paths" title="When is it necessary to use the Save Relative Paths option?">When is it necessary to use the Save Relative Paths option?</a> note. If the paths were already manually configured as relative, they will be preserved and resolved when building, also using the location of the project to absolutize them.</p><p>The <code class="literal">License File</code> setting specifies a license file that will be displayed during installation. The end user will need to accept this license text before continuing with the installation process. If you do not provide a license file, the license acceptance screen will not be displayed to the end user.</p><p>You can also provide an alternate <code class="literal">HTML License File</code>. This HTML-formatted license will be used if the front-end supports it (currently only the case for the Qt front-end).

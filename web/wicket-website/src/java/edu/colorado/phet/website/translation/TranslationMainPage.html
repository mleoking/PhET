        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        There are two ways to get access to edit translations:
        <ul>
            <li>Create your own translation</li>
            <li>Receive access to a translation from someone who already has access</li>
        </ul>
        Once you have access to a translation (or have created one), you can always access it from this page under
        "Editable Translations".

        <h3>Editing</h3>
        To edit a translation, find it under "Editable Translations" and click "edit". This will take you to the
        translation editing page. (Currently it loads slowly, but we are working on improving that). Across the top will
        be a list of categories. When you click on a category, it will display previews on the right and a list of
        phrases (known as <em>strings</em> from now on) on the left that can be edited.
        <p>
            Each string is surrounded by a colored border:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="color: red;">Red</span> borders surround strings that have <strong>not been translated
                yet</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> borders surround strings that have <strong>already been
                translated</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: orange;">orange</span> borders surround strings that have been translated, but are
                <strong>out-of-date and should be updated</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For your convenience, each category above shows the number of untranslated strings (like
            <span style="color: red;">(21)</span>), and out-of-date strings.
        </p>

        <p>
            To edit a string, <strong>click on the text within the colored border</strong>. This will cause it to expand
            into a larger text box that can be typed into. Translate the string by editing or replacing the text. When
            done, either press the TAB key, or click outside of the colored border. The colored border will switch to
            blue to show that the string has now been translated. If available, the previews on the right side of the
            screen will be updated to display the translated string.
        </p>

        <p>
            Above each string will be its key (like "language.name"), and the English version of the text. Notes may
            exist below strings that will provide helpful information for that string.
        </p>

        <h3>Previewing</h3>

        Besides the limited previews that are seen in the translation edit page, the "(open full-site preview)" link
        that is just above the strings will open a new window where you can view the entire website with your
        translation. Clicking on almost all links will keep you within the preview.

        <h3>String Format</h3>

        <p>
            Some strings contain more than plain text. If a string contains a number surrounded with braces (for
            example, <strong>{0}</strong> or <strong>{2}</strong>) then the number and braces will be
            <strong>replaced</strong> with other text when viewed on the website. A good example is a string with the
            key simulationMainPanel.version, which is used to display the version of a simulation:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            How the string is displayed on the left side:
            <span style="background-color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid blue; padding: 3px; font-size: 12px;">
                Version: {0}
            </span>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Example of how the string is displayed in the preview and on the website:
            <span style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 3px; font-size: 12px;">
                Version: 1.17
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>{0}</strong> is known as a <em>placeholder</em>. It is recommended that placeholders be kept,
            but they can be moved to different positions within a string. Just remember they will be replaced. If there
            are placeholders with different numbers, different text will be used to replace them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many times, strings will also contain HTML. For a description of HTML tags, see <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML Element - Wikipedia</a>, which has been translated
            into a number of languages. HTML can be identified when a string has the characters "&lt;" or "&gt;".
            Placeholders and HTML can be present in the same string. For
            example:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            If a string appears like this: 
            <span style="background-color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid blue; padding: 3px; font-size: 12px;">
                &lt;a {0}&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;more information&lt;/strong&gt;.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            It could appear like:
            <span style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 3px; font-size: 12px;">
                <a href="/en/troubleshooting">Click here</a> for <strong>more information</strong>.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, strings that are displayed as multi-line or that include HTML can be broken into multiple lines
            within the editing box. Some strings treat each line differently: learning goals for sims will put each line
            into a bulleted list.
        </p>

        <h3>User Access</h3>

        To give another user access to your translation (or to remove their access), there is a section below the
        strings on the translation edit page titled "User Access". This should allow you to give other users access to
        any translation that you have access to. Additionally, you can remove another user's access.

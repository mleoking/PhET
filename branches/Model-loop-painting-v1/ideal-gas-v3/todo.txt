- white rectangle on right of apparatus panel obscures pump if frame made smaller

done - replace "CM" with "center of mass" on measure tool dialog

============
Sometimes when I try to implement any of the measurement tools, the whole
program freezes.  Sometimes it doesn't.  I can't figure out what makes it
freeze sometimes but not other times.

I would like to see units on the gravity bar, or at least a marker
indicating where normal Earth gravity is on the scale, so that there is
some sense of how what we see in the box relates to what happens in normal
situations on Earth.

I would also like to see units on all the measurement tools and axes
labels (and units) on the energy and speed histograms.  It's really hard
to know what to make of all these numbers without units.

done - I'm assuming "CM lines" means "center of mass lines", but this may not be
obvious to students, so I think it would be better to spell out "center of
mass."

How easy would it be to make it so you could also change the temperature
instantaneously by editing the number on the thermometer with the keyboard
as well as by turning the heat control up and down?  This would be a nice
feature but it's not crucial.

========================

done - something about CM lines

done - On start up condition, controls for heating hot air balloon are cut off, and for rigid hollow sphere the
controls for adding molecules to the sphere is cut off.  "Help" button only appears on 1st panel ... there on other
panels just not visible at start up.

done - Control for measuring temperature and pressure from "Tools" box ... Use a capital P and T for pressure and
temperature, put units after measurement "Atm" and "K".  Use z for height, and label it "units".  E.g. z = 1.68 "units".

- Different modules have different sized panels? Probably because the control panels are different widths.

- Keep Temperature to 3 sig figs only ... no need to display as 273.15, but do display as 1.23 K say for really low Temps.  IMPORTANT: this control must average considerably and only display result after each average.  Try averaging for 5 seconds.  We had talked about having the averaging time controllable right on this device, perhaps just above readout have "Averaging Time:" with just below this a text entry box with the units of seconds next to it... maybe have a 5 in there as the default.

- The molecules are still sticking together in pairs (OK... this was vetoed by everyone else).

done - On Gravity slider, the "Max" wording is misplaced (all panels).

- It would be nice if the pressure gauge bounced around less.  Perhaps one option is if when gravity is off, you actually have 4 slices through the box measuring pressure and the dial is reading out the average of these.  When gravity is on, I don't have a good suggestion.

done - Program freezes when I click "Show Center of Mass" Lines, does not come back when unclick.  This is repeatable.

done - IMPORTANT: energy is not conserved when gravity is ON!  Also, temperature bounces around a lot... can you just take the average T for all levels for this... don't worry about the local temp at the thermometer.

- For rigid hollow sphere balloon:
team review    - When switch between heavy and light on "Gas in Sphere", displayed number does not change appropriately... should reflect current number of that species in the balloon (?) ... if I have 17 blues in there and then I switch to red, number still reads 17.  Also, after selecting other gas button ... if you type value into box ... previously selected gas is put in there... but if you use arrows, then it puts the right color of gas in.  Not sure how to make this control more clear on how many of which type are in the sphere.
done        - IMPORTANT: energy is not conserved when gravity is ON!
        - Some how I got into a mode where there are 10 molecules in the box, but all of the displays say there should be zero. ... no pressure reading or anything even though molecules are bouncing around.  I cannot delete these by typing 0 into number of molecules in the box.  (I got here by adding and deleting light and heavy typing in a number into the number of molecules in the box).  Oh, I tried reset and now the number of molecules reads "-10" and the temperature reads 43K?  If I type zero back into the box... 10 molecules pop out of the pump.

- For the helium balloon:
        - The behavior is much better now!  Looks good to me.
done        - IMPORTANT: energy is not conserved when gravity is ON!

- For the hot air balloon:
done        - IMPORTANT: energy is not conserved when gravity is ON!
done        - When hit reset, it should also move balloon back to where it started... in case it has drifted out of the door (although it is cute when it is just bouncing around the box .. so maybe "reset" should just make sure it's in the box and then if not take action.



===========================================================================================================
- Things are getting repainted all the time, even if things aren't changinig. The performance is pegged.

- move wall until it catches up with the cursor
- scale graphics
- Collision problems: Overlapping particles "dance"
- Enable reset for all modules
- ScalarDataRecorder should computeDataStatistics everytime a datum is added if it isn't a clocked recorder. When I
do it, then make computeDataStatistics() private.
- make needle on dial gauge triangular
- Test setting locale via command line parameter, not property
- Put pump, box and mannequin on common baseline
- consolidate MoleculePanel classes in RigidHollowSphere and HeliumBalloon
- set default energy so kinetic energy is never < 0
- make more versatile & robust collision detection system that works heirarchically with object types
- when hot air balloon is putting in heat, the whole system heats up, but only when gravity is on
- rename and consolidate collision expert/detector classes
- Sam, clockStateListeners
- Make the stove a model element and move IdealGasModel.addHeatFromStove() to Stove.stepInTime()
- check CollidableBody.stepInTimeNoNotify()
- pressure slice graphic overlays mannequin
- scalarDataRecorder should be re-written so it doesn't need a clock, but rather observes an ScalarReporter
- clean up constraints. In particular, there is a lot of duplication in HollowSphereMustContain and
HollowSphereMustNotContain
- hierarchy of Body/.../IdealGasParticle is way too big. Clean it up!
------------------------------------
- Put color L&F on panels
- Look in to moving wall collisions

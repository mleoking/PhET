| INTRODUCTION |
+--------------+

J2SSH Maverick is a Java-based API that implements the SSH1 and SSH2 protocols.  This library is not free to use, however this ANT task may be used in both commercial and non-commercial situations without payment of license fees.  

Maverick is the second generation of our popular open source J2SSH Java SSH library. Designed to be a lightweight and flexible successor to J2SSH, Maverick has been completely rewritten from the ground up to provide the fastest and most extensible SSH library in existence, delivering SSH connectivity to all Java platforms available today.

This library is enhanced by dramatic performance improvements in any Maverick-based SSH application. We are now able to deliver the power and flexibility of the original J2SSH API to all Java platforms, and the API is also now J2ME-ready for the new wave of interconnected devices.

|    USAGE     |
+--------------+

The SSH task implements an SSH client, performing operations such as connecting, authenticating and executing commands on remote servers. SFTP support is included as a subtask of the main SSH task, which itself can send, receive, list, delete files and create directories. The SFTP task has been modelled on the optional Ant FTP task and hence its operation is very similar.

Please see the files sftp.html, exec.html and ssh.html for further information on the correct usage.

| Source Code  |

Source code is now provided (without warranty) for the ant tasks themselves and we welcome any contributions that people have to improve the tasks. The API is a commercial product and therefore source code cannot be provided however if you would like to work on the tasks and submit the source code back to 3SP for inclusion in the next release an extended evaluation license may be provided upon request.

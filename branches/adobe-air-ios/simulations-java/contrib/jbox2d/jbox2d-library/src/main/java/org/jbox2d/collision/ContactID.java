//FIXME: In the C++ version, this class is a union of
//the key and the features, meaning not that it contains
//both separately, but that the same data can be accessed
//as either.  The key there is 32 bit, and each member of
//features is 8 bits.
//
//We need to figure out if this is a problem or not, because
//I have a feeling that as of right now, key is never being
//set anyways.  Initial examination seems to show that key is
//always zero. [hacked around for the moment]
//
//Also, it might be better performance-wise to pull features
//to a top level class if inner classes have more overhead (check this).

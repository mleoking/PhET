The kernel package is the heart of the JME networking module
and controls the routing and dispatch of message data over
different transport implementations.  Most users will never 
have to deal with these classes unless they are writing their own 
client and server implementations that diverge from the standard 
classes that are provided.

<p>{@link com.jme3.network.kernel.Kernel} defines the core of a server-side message
broker that abstracts away the specific transport and underlying
threading model used.  For example, it might use NIO selectors
in a single threaded model or straight multithreaded socket
model.  Or it might implement SSL connections.  Once created,
{@link com.jme3.network.kernel.Kernel} users don't need to care about the details.</p>

<p>{@link com.jme3.network.kernel.Endpoint} is a managed connection within a 
{@link com.jme3.network.kernel.Kernel} providing kernel to client connectivity.</p>

<p>{@link com.jme3.network.kernel.Connector} defines the basic client-side message sender
and these objects are typically used to connect to a {@link com.jme3.network.kernel.Kernel} 
though they can connect to any network port that supports the implementation's
protocol.  Implementations are provided for straight TCP and UDP communication
and could be extended to support SSL or different threading models.</p>

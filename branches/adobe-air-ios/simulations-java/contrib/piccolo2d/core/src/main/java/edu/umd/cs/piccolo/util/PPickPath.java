/**
 * <b>PPickPath</b> represents a ordered list of nodes that have been picked.
 * The topmost ancestor node is the first node in the list (and should be a
 * camera), the bottommost child node is at the end of the list. It is this
 * bottom node that is given first chance to handle events, and that any active
 * event handlers usually manipulate.
 * <p>
 * Note that because of layers (which can be picked by multiple camera's) the
 * ordered list of nodes in a pick path do not all share a parent child
 * relationship with the nodes in the list next to them. This means that the
 * normal localToGlobal methods don't work when trying to transform geometry up
 * and down the pick path, instead you should use the pick paths canvasToLocal
 * methods to get the mouse event points into your local coord system.
 * <p>
 * Note that PInputEvent wraps most of the useful PPickPath methods, so often
 * you can use a PInputEvent directly instead of having to access its pick path.

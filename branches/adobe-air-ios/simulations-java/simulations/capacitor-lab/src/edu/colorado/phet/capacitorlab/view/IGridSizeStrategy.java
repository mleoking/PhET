     * Strategy developed by Sam Reid, here's how he described it:
     * The main change is to use rounding instead of clamping to get the rows and columns.
     * Also, for one row or column, it should be exact (similar to the intent of the ModifiedCCKGridSizeStrategy subclass).
     * It looks like it exhibits better (though understandably imperfect) behavior in the problem cases.
     * Also, as opposed to the previous versions, the visible number of objects can exceed the specified numberOfObjects.
     * This may be the best we can do if we are showing a rectangular grid of charges.  We could get the count exactly
     * right if we show some (or one) of the columns having different numbers of charges than the others, but then
     * it may look nonuniform (and would require more extensive changes to the sim).

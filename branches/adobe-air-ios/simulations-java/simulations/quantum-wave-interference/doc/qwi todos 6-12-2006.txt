I've figured out what the problem is with the asymmetry in the Two 
Lasers panel in QWI: the center of the left laser is 14 pixels from the 
left edge of the box and the center of the right laser is only 13 pixels 
from the edge of the box.  My guess is that you're measuring the 
distance from the center of the box, but it's rounding in some weird way 
  because there are an odd numbers of pixels (45) in the box.  Can you 
fix this?

Also, I did another interview on Saturday and there were more problems 
with asymmetry in the other two panels.  If you make the simulation full 
screen so it's easy to see the individual pixels, you can see that 
changing the width and separation of the slits often changes things in 
very weird asymmetric ways.

Remember when we were working on units in QWI and there was a mysterious 
factor of 10 that I couldn't figure out, so I told you to just roll it 
in and not worry about it?  Well, I finally figured out where it came 
from!  The units on the ruler for matter particles are off by a factor 
of 10.  Rather than being 0.45nm wide, the box should be 4.5nm wide, so 
the units on the ruler should be 10 times as large.  To compensate for 
this, we made the units per clock tick 10x too small.

The current units per clock tick are:

Electrons    0.005 fs
Neutrons    0.01 ps
He Atoms    0.05 ps
(At medium resolution, divide these numbers by 4, at high, by 16)


The correct units per clock tick are:

Electrons    0.05 fs
Neutrons    0.1 ps
He Atoms    0.5 ps
(At medium resolution, divide these numbers by 4, at high, by 16)

Just found a small bug: If I resize the simulation, the close and rotate 
buttons on the ruler move off the ruler.  Also, if I put the ruler too 
far to the right and make the simulation size smaller, the ruler goes 
off the screen and I can't get it back without resizing.
I should mention that the bug is only there when the ruler is rotated 
vertically.

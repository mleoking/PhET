Model Description for PhET's Gravity and Orbits Sim

We use the velocity verlet integration for stepping forward in time, see http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~ercolessi/md/md/node21.html
400 iterations are used for each time step to improve accuracy without slowing down the computation too much.

Cartoon mode list makes the radii of all objects much larger than the true physical values to make them visible on the same scale.
In the Sun/Earth cartoon modes, the Earth mass is multiplied by 10200 to keep the moon in orbit.  Here is how the cartoon Sun/Earth/Moon model is different than the correct physical values:

    //Increase the sizes of each body so they can be seen
    sun.radius *= 50; //This means the sun is 50 times bigger
    earth.radius *= 800;
    moon.radius *= 800;

    final int earthMassScaleFactor = 10200; //Tuned by hand so there are 12 cartoon lunar orbits in one cartoon earth orbit
    earth.mass *= earthMassScaleFactor;
    moon.vx *= 21;
    moon.y = earth.radius * 1.7;

    forceScale *= 0.573 / earthMassScaleFactor;//to balance increased mass and so that forces are 1/2 grid cell in default conditions
    timeScale = 365.0 / 334.0;//Have to artificially scale up the time readout so that Sun/Earth/Moon mode has a stable orbit with correct periods since masses are nonphysical
    sun.fixed = true;//Sun shouldn't move in cartoon modes

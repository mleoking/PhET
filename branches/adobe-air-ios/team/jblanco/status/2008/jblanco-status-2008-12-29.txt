December 29, 2008

Note: This report covers the period from December 18 through December 29, 2008.

States of Matter Sim - 13.0 hrs

•	Implemented new button and diagram interaction.
•	Implemented slider to control epsilon for configurable molecule.
•	Fixed some issues with translation support that were reported by French translator.
•	Implemented two-line buttons for showing the phase and interaction potential diagrams.
•	Worked on and am almost done with changes to make the configurable atom behave more like the other monatomic atoms when the potential curves are similar.
•	Updated licensing information.

Nuclear Fission Sim - 12.5 hrs

•	Modified ray gun created by Noah P. for the needs of this sim and incorporated it.  This was necessary due to licensing issues surrounding the previous ray gun image.
•	Made the "Fire!" button on the ray gun translatable (though this has now been removed).
•	Replaced the "Fire!" button with a button with no text.
•	Changed the title of the energy generation portion of the graph on the Nuclear Reactor tab from "Total Energy" to "Energy Produced".
•	Published several versions for review and obtained feedback.
•	Updated licensing information for the images.

Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign - 0.0 hrs

•	No work on this sim for this time period.

Installer & Web Site - 3.0 hrs

•	Followed up with Orrie about our quota.  We are using about 3GB of our 8GB quota.
•	Verified that automated build and backup process is working correctly.
•	Updated the XML schema for Unfuddle on phet-server.

PhET Server - 2.0

•	Updated the XML schema for Unfuddle on phet-server.
•	Verified and committed changes made by Sam to the Unfuddle email server.

Meetings & Email - 9.5 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Worked with Sam and Chris on putting together a release plan for the March '09 redeployment of all sims.  See Unfuddle #1049 for notes from this meeting.
•	Normal email overhead.

Holidays - 24.0 hrs

•	December 24, 25, & 26 taken as holidays.

Upcoming Work

•	Finalize the configurable attraction atom for SOM.
•	Get SOM tested and deploy latest version to production server.
•	Fix identified issues on TAD that are standing in the way of interviews.
•	Try accounting for gravitational potential energy in SOM (limit to 2 hrs).
•	Start on the revised Interaction Potential sim.
•	Figure out when we will need to get signing certificate and start the ball rolling.
•	Work on Unfuddle issues that are assigne

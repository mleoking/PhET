States of Matter Sim - 29 hrs

* Finished implementation of normalized-to-Kelvin temperature conversion for Neon and Argon.
* Removed autoscaling of the thermometer.
* Changed the spacing on the water molecules to increase the perceived volume.
* Implemented code for direct phase transition to liquid from either solid or gaseous state.
* Added code to disallow pumping when squished below 1/2 nominal container size.
* Implemented limitations to rate of change of the container size.
* Implemented a modified pressure calculation in order to make pressure reading more steady.
* Implemented a "fragmented" container image in order to be able to use graphical container on Macs (still testing).
* Improved the look of the phase diagram based on input from Paul Beale.
* Cleaned up unused images and updated the license file.
* Worked with Noah P and Paul B to finalize approach on a user interface issue.
* Worked with Paul B on how to make the container resizing correctly affect the temperature.

Nuclear Physics - 2.0 hrs

* Reviewed list of requested changes from Noah P. and provided estimates to implement.
* Updated license file.

Circuit Construction Kit - 2.5 hrs

* Reviewed current list of bugs with Sam R. and together provided estimates to fix/implement each.


Web Site - 1.5 hrs

* Helped Marj to work out how to update publications.
* Regression tested the installer builder after Sam R. fixed the language properties problem.


Meetings & Email - 4.0 hrs

* Regular weekly status meeting.
* Various discussions with Noah P, Paul B, Sam R, and Kathy in person and via email.

Misc - 1.0

* Created one-page CV, needed by Wendy for Hewlett proposal.

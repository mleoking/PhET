Nuclear Physics Sim

* Continuing to focus primarily on getting this sim working in new framework.
* Worked extensively with Kathy Perkins and Mike Dubson to create a "dynamic 
  nucleus" for the Alpha Radiation tab.
* Added legend and reset to the control panel.
* Labels, legend, and other graphics now correctly appearing on chart on Alpha
  Radiation tab.
* Started on the "Fission: One Nucleus" tab and have created the chart and have 
  the nucleus appearing in the center.
* Continuing to ramp up, i.e. becoming more familiar with the established code
  base, the Java APIs, and the tools and environment.

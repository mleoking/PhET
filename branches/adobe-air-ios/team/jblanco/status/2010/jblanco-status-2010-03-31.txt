PhET Weekly Progress Report

March 31, 2010

Note: This report covers a two-week period from March 18th through March 31st, during much of which I was out on vacation.

Lac Operon - 13.0 hrs

•	Generalized the lactose injector to be able to point at any angle so that it can be used on 2nd tab.
•	Got the lactose injector correctly positioned and oriented on the 2nd tab and able to inject lactose above the cell membrane.
•	Designed and implemented the behavior for lactose crossing the membrane into the cell, including getting LacZ to embed into the cell membrane and move lactose across.
•	Corrected simulation bounds so that nothing would appear to penetrate into the cell membrane unintentionally.
•	Added cursor handler for close buttons on the lactose meter and the legend (feedback from Chris M).
•	Fixed an issue where an exception could occur if strand was built up with everything except a lac operator.
•	Fixed an issue where the LacI was being produced too high and running into the cell membrane.
•	Published a version for review that contains the first cut of the lactose-crossing-the-membrane behavior on the 2nd tab.
•	Set up a review meeting with Kathy P and Noah P to discuss whether we want to implement all 3 of the additional tabs currently described in the specification (Thursday, April 1 @ 3pm).

Neuron Sim - 12.0 hrs

•	Made the zoom remain unchanged when showing/hiding the membrane chart (feedback from Chris M).
•	Put together a quick prototype of the membrane diffusion tab - essentially just the picture from the spec embedded in the tab.
•	Organized and prioritized feedback from most recent review meeting with Noah P.
•	Changed appearance and behavior of "Stimulate Neuron" button based on input from Noah P.
•	Made the traveling action potential expand and then shrink when it reaches the cross section, as requested by Noah P.
•	Added close button to membrane potential chart.
•	Did some internal renaming of classes in order to prevent overlap with the upcoming implementation of the Membrane Diffusion Tab.
•	Implemented the "Show Bulk Charges" feature, which allows the user to select whether they see the ions that exist outside and inside the cell prior to and after the action potential.

Web Site - 1.0 hrs

•	Put up a placeholder for a link that was mentioned in the April issue of Physics Teacher (requested by Kathy P).
 
Miscellaneous Issues - 2.0

•	Checked the SVN mirror that runs on phet-server, found it to be blocked by an authentication issue, fixed it.
•	Updated several older Unfuddle tickets, resolved and closed several.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 4.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Sick Leave, and Holidays - 48 hrs

•	Vacation time.

Lac Operon Sim - 16.5 hrs

•	Noah P and I held a review of version 0.0.05 with Jared T and George S of UBC.  Reviewed version can be found here: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/gene-network/0.0.05/.
•	Implemented changes recommended by UBC guys, including:
-	Limit LacIs produced to 2 or 3 per mRNA strand.
-	LacI bonds to lac operator for 1.5x as long.
-	Adjusted labels to look more like the conventions used by biologists.
-	Created layers on the canvas and arranged model elements to overlap in less confusing ways.
-	Added the ability to manually move LacI and RNA Polymerase to the locations where they bind to the DNA.
-	Made LacI release lactose after bonding to it for a while instead of fading away.
-	Have started work on adding the ability to set up automatic periodic injection of lactose.
•	Added a close button (i.e. a red x) to the legend.
•	Cleanup - Removed code that is now unused due to various changes to requirements and design.
•	Fixed various minor issues found during unit testing.
•	This sim is very close to the point where initial interviews can be conducted, which Noah P plans to do as soon as the students return for the Spring semester.

Neuron Sim - 0.5 hrs

•	Discussed model design and user interface ideas with Noah P.

Unfuddle Issues - 3.0 hrs

•	Tested workaround for gray rect problem (Unfuddle #89 and #2072), found it to be not working.
•	Worked with Chris to resolve issues with workaround for gray rect problem.
•	Worked with Marj to help support a user in The Netherlands that is creating a Virtual Learning Environment and wants to incorporate PhET sims (Unfuddle issue #2073).
•	Had some email dialog with people in India that are trying to set up an environment using PhET sims and are having issues using Firefox (Unfuddle #2079).

Development Environment - 1.0

•	Installed a tool in Eclipse that locates "dead code", i.e. software elements that do not appear to be used by anything.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 3.0 hrs

•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

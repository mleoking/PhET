PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
April 28, 2010

Note: This report covers two weeks, from April 15th through April 28th, 2010.  This is because the weekly meeting was cancelled last week due to meetings with the O'Donnell Foundation representatives.

Neuron Sim - 41.0 hrs

•	Met with the IPhy people for review and feedback.
•	Added all channel types to tool box.
•	Reviewed with Noah P (twice) and did several adjustments during the review.
•	Adjusted layout of Membrane Diffusion tab to work when maximized on a number of different monitor sizes.
•	Increased the number of channels allowed on the membrane.
•	Created and integrated a "fake" Hodgkin-Huxley model to control the gates on the Membrane Diffusion tab.
•	Added the graphs and got them working.
•	Made the membrane appearance consistent between the two existing tabs.
•	Reduced the default speed for both tabs (requested by Noah P).
•	Fixed issue with particles bouncing from centers instead of edges.
•	Adjusted color of sodium leak gate for clearer correlation with sodium (IPhy request).
•	Implemented assymetric bi-directional flow of ions through leak channels (IPhy request).
•	Modified overall and relative density of bulk ions (IPhy request).
•	Made the inactivation gate on the gated sodium channel not pop out until channel fully closed back up (IPhy request).
•	Made the sodium gates open more quickly (IPhy request).
•	Added staggering in the timing of the open and close of the gated channels (IPhy request).
•	Lengthened time before neuron can be re-stimulated so that the refractory period is over (IPhy request).
•	Got all parts of the Action Potential tab set up for translation.
•	Removed vestigial code from earlier versions of this sim.
•	Performed "Dead Code" analysis, started removal all such code.

Lac Operon - 11.0 hrs

•	Fixed issue where lactose level stays too high when there is a lot of it in the cell.
•	Reviewed with Noah P and adjusted several behavioral parameters.
•	Made LacZ live longer when there is a lot of lactose in order to bring the level down more rapidly.
•	Made sure everything was internationalized, cleaned up the code.
•	Published updated version.

O'Donnel Foundation Visit - 10.0 hrs

•	Put together presentation of our Software Development Process, discussed/reviewed with Kathy.
•	Met with the representatives, presented our development process.

Support of Concord Consortium - 4.0 hrs

•	Reviewed their requests, had dialog via email.
•	Had phone meeting with them (with Chris M).
•	Wrote up meeting notes, set up Unfuddle ticket, input notes, email dialogs, etc.
•	Provided them with information on how to modify the distribution tag.

Support of Pearson - 0.5

•	Responded to questions about hosting, connected the individual with other people at Pearson that we have worked with there.

Phethelp Support - 1.5

•	(Helping to cover for Marj while she is away).
•	Responded to user with questions about States of Matter sim (#2269)
•	Worked with Trish to respone to a user with questions about Gas Properties sim (#2268).
•	Took call from user with general questions, referred to Kathy Dessau.

Development Environment - 1.0

•	Set up backups and performed initial full backup.

Miscellaneous - 1.0

•	Resolved an issue with the time setting on phet-server.
•	Reponded to question from a user about how to host the PhET simulations.
•	Helped Chris M diagnose some email issues that he was having.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 10.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

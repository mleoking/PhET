PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
November 10, 2010

Build an Atom - 16.25 hrs (much of this work done in collaboration with Sam R) 

•	Met twice with the Chemistry Group to review feedback we have received and decide on changes.
•	Changed the nucleus configuration algorithm so that it is easier to count nucleons.  This makes the Bohr model representation easier to use in the game.
•	Added a label to the selection buttons for Netural Atom / Ion.
•	Reversed order of charge pair indicator to more closely match the legend.
•	Made the Neutral Atom / Ion selector that appears on some of the game views only be visible after the user has selected an element.
•	Made the check button on the game canvas disabled until the user has input some initial guess.
•	Tested the confirmation dialog for starting a new game.
•	Fixed an issue where the spinners used in the game were too small on the Mac platform.
•	Various internal refactorings to improve maintainability and reduce code size.
•	Added check boxes for showing name, stable/unstable, and neutral/ion.
•	Added interlock between animation control and visibility of stable/unstable labels.
•	Made the cloud representation be one big cloud instead of two nested ones at the same diameter as the shells in the Bohr view.
•	Published several new versions for use in interviews.

Acid-Base Solutions - 4.0 hrs

•	Acted as moderator for postmortem.
•	Summarized and edited notes from meeting and circulated to participants.
•	Updated Phet Look & Feel guidelines based on results of meeting.
•	Added notes from meeting to the Unfuddle notebook.

Molecules and Light - 2.5 hrs

•	Separated out the photon emitter so that different control panels can be attached to it.
•	Added initial portions of photon emission control panel for this sim.

Work and Energy - 1.0 hr

•	Worked with Sam on the correct initial positioning of the measuring stick.

Isotope - 1.0 hr

•	Created a drawing of the first tab.

Gravity and Orbits - 0.25 hrs

•	Tested on Mac and provided feedback to Sam R.

Common Code - 3.0 hrs

•	Added DisableableGradientButtonNode from the Neuron sim to the common code (in collab with Sam R).
•	Added the ability to be disabled to the GradientButtonNode (in collab with Chris M).
•	Tested changes to Vector2DNode on States of Matter and Atomic Interactions.

Environment - 1.0 hrs

•	Tracked down an issue with VNC’ing into the Big Mac, temporarily corrected the issue.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 11.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET team meeting (x2, since this week's meeting was moved from Thu to Wed).
•	Meeting on how to report developer time.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Planning one or two additional days of vacation prior to Thanksgiving.

What’s Next

•	Support interviews on Build an Atom.
•	Continue code development on Molecules & Light.
•	Implement any changes resulting from interviews on Membrane Channels (if conducted).

Beta Decay - 19.0 hrs

•	Implemented beta decay behavior on 2nd tab.
•	Got custom nucleus working on 1st and 2nd tabs, including half life adjustment.
•	Got reset working on 2nd tab.
•	Added the capability to morph a neutron to a proton (since that is what happens in beta decay).
•	Made jiggling and explosions more subtle on 1st tab, based on feedback from last meeting.
•	Created better animation algorithm for the nucleons that make up the nuclei on the 2nd tab.
•	Improved (hopefully) the overall color scheme of nucleus labels and backgrounds.
•	Changed labels for Y axis of chart on 2nd tab to be more logical and to scale with chart size.
•	Enhanced the control panel so that user can select nucleus type by clicking on image, and not just the radio button.
•	Tweaked rate of time passing and time spans for graphs for the various nucleus configurations.
•	Generalized the multi-nucleus time chart to work on multiple tabs, eliminated redundant classes.
•	Continued refactoring for improved extensibility and maintainability.
•	Published version to dev and solicited feedback.

Atomic Interactions - 9.0 hrs

•	Review meeting with Jack B et al to discuss results of student interviews.
•	Changed atom selection to be a fixed list of pairs rather than independently selectable.
•	Removed cross from blue marker ball on chart.
•	Added in developer controls so that Noah (or whoever) can experiment with background colors.
•	Made force arrows transparent so as not to be so overwhelming.
•	Added clock speed control slider.
•	Published (twice) for collecting feedback from dev team.

Radiometric Dating Game – 4.0 hrs

•	Fixed an issue with the Y-axis of proportions graph when C14/C12 ratio is selected.
•	Integrated new background from Noah so that clouds aren't obscured by meter and chart.
•	Looked for sounds to integrate, had little luck due to licensing issues.
•	Enlarged graph on 3rd tab to be more readable, moved the ground to compensate.

Miscellaneous - 4.0

•	Helped Trish to get set up with VNC for remote testing on Mac.
•	Spoke with a guy who called the office and is trying to put together a commercial educational web site.
•	Helped Marj with a phethelp issue involving updates.
•	Updated CS4 license, conveyed license number to Jonathan so he could do the same.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 4.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.

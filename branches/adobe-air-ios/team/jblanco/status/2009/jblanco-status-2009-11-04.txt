PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
November 4, 2009

Lac Operon Sim - 19.0 hrs

•	Implemented random walk and weighted random walk motion strategies in order to get realistic motion that moves toward a destination.
•	Implemented initial bonding behavior.
•	Improved layout of the legend panel.
•	Worked with Sam R on the design of the model.

Young and Freedman Installer - 4.0 hrs

•	Implemented initial version of this as essentially a copy of the KSU variant.  Currently being tested.
•	Worked with Jonathan O to determine what changes are needed to the Wicket web site to support this installer.
•	Implemented link substitution code to make the mirror point to the main phet site for the installers.
•	Started investigating why ripping of the web site is so slow, which leads to a very long turnaround on the build-test-fix cycle for this effort.

KSU Installer & Support - 2.5 hrs

•	Verified removal of English portion built properly, deployed to Spot in case it is needed.
•	Logged in via FTP to the KSU server, started looking around to try to figure out how to fix their configuration issue.
•	Requested SSH access to the KSU server, but it sounds like this isn't something with which they are comfortable.

Neuron Sim - 1.0 hrs

•	Worked with Noah on writing up learning goals.

Web Site and (non-KSU) Installer - 5.0 hrs

•	Worked with Marj to deploy phetcommon-fonts.properties to all sims.  This required working through several issues with the process.
•	Regression tested sims to make sure that bulk deployment didn't break anything.
•	Verified the Khmer sims now work with the new phetcommon-fonts file deployed.

User Support - 1.0 hrs

•	Helped (via email) a customer running Windows 7 who was having issues with getting Java sims to work.
•	Helped (via email) a customer who was having issues with getting JAR files to work under BSD Unix.

Miscellaneous - 2.5 hrs

•	Investigated whether there is a reasonably easy way to determine if our JAR signatures are correctly time stamped (because I noticed something that made me suspect that they may not be).  This is ongoing - it turns out to be a bit tricky.
•	Investigated issue and worked on setting up a meeting for coming up with better handling of exotic fonts in Flash sims.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Lac Operon Sim - 30.0 hrs

•	Finished implementation of lactose injection.
•	Implemented lactose binding with LacI and subsequently changing its shape so that it can't attach to DNA.
•	Implemented fade-out and removal of LacI-lactose combination.
•	Implemented lactose breakdown by LacZ.
•	Made polymerase only transcribe when actually moving over the gene.  This looks better and will help as we move towards having the polymerase transcribe other genes.
•	Met with Noah P to discuss progress and plan next steps.
•	Removed unused tabs so they wouldn't be distracting to reviewers.
•	Published a version to dev for review.  This can be seen here: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/gene-network/0.0.02/
•	Held a review with Jared Taylor and George Spiegelman of UBC, got some good feedback.
•	Started work on the changes suggested by Jared and George.
•	Started implementation of polymerase "bumping" against lacI when blocked.

Neuron - 1.5 hrs

•	Reviewed current status with Noah P, discussed model to use for moving forward.
•	Planning to start spending more time on this one while next phases of Lac Operon are worked out.

Custom Installers - 0.5 hrs

•	Tested the KSU site, verified several Java and Flash sims, reported to Hisham.  Everything looks good so far.

Development Environment and Tools - 4.0 hrs

•	Wrote up a general checklist for deployment of new sims.
•	Resolved some issues that were occurring in my local environment with Eclipse and SVN.
•	Worked on issues with the Unfuddle Notifier that were preventing it from sending emails.  This was tracked down to an email account issue.
•	Updated the Unfuddle Notifier with the latest project schema.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 4.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
September 28th, 2011

Time period covered: September 22nd through September 28th.

Balance and Torque - 17.5 hrs

•	Reviewed and discussed plan for HS version in weekly Physics group meeting.
•	Changed the game so that mass deduction challenges would be interspersed throughout the various levels, getting harder as the level increases.
•	Discussed various plans with Ariel.
•	Made bold tick marks on every other slot instead of every 4th one.
•	Made Reset All return the tool kit to the initial position.
•	Fixed issue where some of the challenges would end up with the fixed mass on the right side.
•	Made the image names, their source files, and the names used in the code all be consistent.
•	Annotated images in the license file.
•	Resized some of the graphics so that they would not be scaled up, which improves visual appearance.
•	Made the mass deduction challenges static.
•	After feedback, made the mass deduction challenges back to being dynamic.
•	Changed the mass labels on the mystery objects from being invisible to being question marks.
•	Added multi-mass challenges, currently at level 4 only.

Gene Expression Basics - 4.0 hrs

•	Created separate view class for mRNA.
•	Fixed bug where model didn't recognize that transcription factors had been removed from the DNA on a Reset All.
•	Looked at Optical Tweezers - code and sim behavior - for example of wound up DNA strand.
•	Worked on algorithm for causing the mRNA to curl up when synthesized.

Molecule Polarity - 4.0 hrs

•	Code review, see Unfuddle #3088.

Common Code - 1.5 hrs

•	Participated in email discussion about varying the color schemes of sims to better support projectors and handouts.
•	Participated in discussion via Unfuddle ticket #3086.

Environment- 1.0 hrs

•	Looking for solutions to some issues with SVN - which seemed to originate at Unfuddle's end.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Weekly Physics team meeting.
•	Weekly status report.
•	Review, prioritization, and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 7.0 hrs

•	4 hrs sick leave on Monday, September 26th.
•	3 hrs vacation time on Wednesday, September 28th.

What’s Next

•	Continue developing Balance & Torque simulation - finish game, move towards initial publication.
•	Continue developing Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue developing States of Matter: Basics.

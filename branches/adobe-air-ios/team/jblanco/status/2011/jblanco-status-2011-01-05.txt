Time period covered: December 30th through January 5th.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 14.0 hrs

•	Added the ability to the view to handle particles coming and going to/from the model.
•	Got the neutron bucket added and holding neutrons.
•	Implemented handling for transferring neutrons between the particle and the bucket.
•	Created a version of the atom node in which the protons and electrons are not interactive.
•	Added the stability indicator.
•	Worked on overall layout of the canvas.
•	Internal code cleanup.
•	Added periodic table, got it working to set the atom configuration in a prototype sort of way.
•	Fixed some issues with the periodic table that were preventing it from being used to set the atom configuration.
•	Added developer control for animation of unstable nuclei.
•	Internal code cleanup.

Greenhouse (in collaboration with Sam R, with input from Kathy P) - 4.0 hrs

•	Fixed a bug where the equilibrium temperature was lower than it should have been.
•	Fixed a bug where the ice age temperature was different when all photons were visible, see #2641.

Molecules and Light - 3.0 hrs

•	Made the arrows on the photon wavelength selection panel interactive, such that the now move to higher or lower frequencies.
•	Made the radio buttons for selecting photon wavelength larger.
•	Participated in discussions about how to make it clear to the users that it is photons that are being emitted.
•	Published a version for review.

Gravity and Orbits - 1.0 hrs

•	Created a test app for comparing checkboxes in play area to those on a Swing panel.

Common Code - 2.0 hrs

•	Tested and reviewed changes to AtomNode, see Unfuddle #2615.
•	Worked with Chris M on generalization of and name change for the AtomNode class.
•	Worked with Chris M on an issue where the "About" dialog was assuming that all URLs were license files.

Environment - 2.0

•	Updated to the latest SVN plugin in an attempt to fix some SVN issues.  This appears to have worked (so far anyway).
•	Created an Eclipse template for a simple main routine with a Piccolo canvas.
•	Created an Eclipse template for a simple app with both a control panel and a play area.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Participated in discussion of web code refactoring.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 8.0 hrs

•	Jan 3rd was a university holiday (though I took Dec 31st off instead).

What’s Next

•	Continue development of Isotopes and Atomic Mass simulation.
•	Make minor mods to Molecules & Light based on initial feedback.
•	Research and order new PC.

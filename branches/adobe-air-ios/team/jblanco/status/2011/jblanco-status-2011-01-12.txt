PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
January 12, 2011

Time period covered: January 6th through January 12th.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 17.0 hrs

•	Made the periodic table work to set the atom configuration.
•	Made the lower portion of the table grayed out to convey that it is unusable for setting the atom configuration.
•	Reviewed with Chemistry Group at weekly meeting (Thursday Jan 7th).
•	Major refactoring to consolidate and simplify the code for representing atoms to make it easier to share between BAA and Isotopes.
•	Created a button-based version of the periodic table.
•	Added the scale that weighs the atom.
•	Created an internal table that maps nucleus configurations to atomic mass and abundance in nature.  Information was obtained from NIST web site.

Build an Atom - 3.5 hrs

•	Answered questions raised by Chris M. during code review.
•	Participated in post-mortem.
•	Made a PDF "snapshot" of the design document and checked into SVN.
•	Updated web site screen shot to depict an already built atom.
•	Corrected the title.

Molecules and Light - 1.0 hrs

•	Discussed feedback from various reviewers during the Chemistry Group meeting.
•	Minor change to cursor behavior over the energy arrows.

Greenhouse - 0.5 hrs

•	Tested recent changes for bug fixes.

Lac Operon - 1.0 hrs

•	Fixed two untranslatable strings that were found by a translator, see #2659.

Common Code - 0.5 hrs

•	Code review of the KSU credits code.

Licensing - 1.0

•	Scanned CD cover and sent to Kathy, typed up the writing on the disk itself.

Customer Support - 2.5

•	Investigated (with Jonathan) a report of malware in the files associated with the Young & Freedman (Pearson) distribution, see #2655.
•	Regenerated the Y&F distribution, tested it, and posted it for download.
•	Had a dialog with the customer about the origin of the malware.

Environment - 4.0

•	Updated the XML project schema for the Unfuddle notifier.
•	Filed support request with Unfuddle to fix the means for obtaining a project schema or help us to find an alternative.
•	Prepped for asbestos mitigation (moving cables, etc).
•	Participated in discussion of how to redeploy all sims but minimize testing time.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 9.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	PhET developer meeting.
•	Entered December hours into tracking spreadsheet.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	No vacation on the immediate horizon.

What’s Next

•	Finish 1st tab of the Isotopes sim.
•	Work on 2nd tab of the Isotopes sim.
•	Collaborate with Kathy on the design of some new biology simulations.
•	Research and order new PC.

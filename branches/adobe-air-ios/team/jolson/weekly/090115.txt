Friday 1/9
	Accessibility 9:45am-2:20pm
		Research into tab control and capture issue, found solution
		and fixed. Heavy modifications to design, including structure
		to store information for controls in the tab-order.
	Internationalization 3:00pm-6:45pm
		Fixing .html generation for new format of locale instead of
		the faulty "country code" that was used before.
		Additionally fixes for various parts of flash-common and
		SimStrings for compatibility.
	Accessibility 7:15pm-9:40, 10:00-11:35pm
		Fixes for accessibility tests. determining bounds for
		movieclips and text fields, and movieclip workaround for
		buttons.
Saturday 1/10
	---
Sunday 1/11
	Accessibility 7:30pm-9:25pm
		Initial retrofitting of pendulum-lab with the keyboard accessibility,
		and efforts to debug projectile-motion accessibility issues.
Monday 1/12
	Accessibility 1:00pm-4:15pm
		Continued modifications to pendulum-lab components for
		keyboard accessibility (they are mostly shared between sims,
		work would be significantly lower for next sims). Added capability
		for components to modify the focus (for instance, if a text
		field is selected with the mouse)
	Tracking 5:45pm-11:45pm
		Research and discussion into Flash specifics for the new
		tracking changes. Fully updated flash-common to conform
		to the new tracking information, including recording
		and tracking sim-specific information (visits-since, visits-ever)
		in preferences, a debugging system to reset preferences,
		preferences version control, handling privacy agreement version,
		removing unused tracking functionality, server-side modifications
		for storing tracking information, and testing.
Tuesday 1/13
	Accessibility 9:45am-1:00pm
		Updates and changes to keyboard accessibility to function
		with AsWing. Included research into interfacing with AsWing
		movieclip hierarchy, and disabling the AsWing focus handling
		system.
	Flash Common 1:15pm-2:15pm
		Modifications to the source tree as in #1002, and
		discussion. Required modfiication of .html generation,
		deploy scripts, and include directories for each simulation
		in testing.
	Flash Common 6:35pm-7:00pm
		More modifications to source tree, with localization
		and .html generation
	Internationalization 7:50pm-11:15pm
		Integration of flash-common internationalization
		strings. This included creating two examples for
		english and spanish, .html build script modifications
		to embed them (debugging since my editor didn't
		save the spanish in UTF-8), inclusion into flash-common
		for buttons and the about dialog, and a utility
		similar to SimStrings for common code.
Wednesday 1/14
	Tracking 3:45pm-7:00pm, 7:30pm-9:00pm
		Refactored common code to handle new
		dialog that appears "before" the sim does for
		privacy restrictions. This included reworking
		the order and design of how the common code
		is loaded, when messages are sent, necessary
		changes to the individual sims as to when the
		common code is initialized, adding the dialog and
		its functionality.
	Accessibility 9:00pm-11:15pm
		Debugging of keyboard accessibility for use
		with simulations. Turned out to be AsWing
		using setFocus and tabIndex even when
		its FocusManager was disabled.
	Tracking 11:15pm-12:00am
		Changes to the new privacy dialog, including
		bugfixes with accessibility, hiding the sim with
		the correct background color (and associated
		changes for .html generation).
Thursday 1/15
	Tracking 12:00am-12:20am
		continued from Wednesday above
	Internationalization 12:20am-12:35am
		Examination of internationalization for a few sims
		necessary to evaluate time for changes to SimStrings

Totals:
	Accessibility 18:15
	Tracking 10:50
	Internationalization 6:55
	Flash Common 1:25

Overall: 38:25

Graphing Linear Inequalities (design notes)

Requirements from 7/26/11 meeting:
• slope-intercept format only (y = mx + b)
• chose relational operator via radio buttons placed below equation
• order of relation operator buttons: <, <=, =, >=, >
• tooltips for relational operator buttons?
• shade above/below line with transparent color
• use dashed line for <, >
• no standard lines (y=x, y=-x) feature
• no Save/Erase lines feature
• toggle rise/run brackets via "Slope" check box
• "Hide plot" check box (similar to "Hide lines" in Line Graphing)
• point tools (start with 2)
• first tab: 1 line
• second tab: compare 2 lines
• need to work out color scheme for 2-line case, to differentiate lines and manipulators
• Game tab design?

Capacitor Lab model

// constants
epsilon_0 = vacuum permittivity, F/m = 8.854E-12
epsilon_a = dielectric constant of air, dimensionless = 1.00058986

// settings(all tabs)
V = battery voltage, volts (-10 to +10)

// settings (Introduction and Dielectric tabs)
d = plate separation, meters (.005 to .010)
L = plate side length, meters (.010 to .020)
offset = how far dielectric is pulled out, meters (0 to .020)
epsilon_r = dielectric constant, dimensionless (1 to 10)

// settings (Multiple Capacitors tab)
C = capacitance, Farads (1E-13 to 3E-13)

// derived
A = plate area, meters^2 = L * L
A_dielectric = area dielectric between plates, meters^2 = ( L - offset ) * L
C = capacitance, Farads = ( ( A_dielectric * epsilon_r / A ) + ( ( A - A_dielectric ) * epsilon_a / A ) ) * ( epsilon_0 * A / d )
Q = plate charge, Coulombs = C * V
Q_excess = excess plate charge, Coulombs = (epsilon_r - epsilon_a) * epsilon_0 * (A_dielectric / d ) * V
sigma = surface charge density, Coulombs/meters^2 = Q / A
E_effective = effective field, Volts/meter = sigma / ( epsilon_r * epsilon_0)
E_plates = field due to plates, Volts/meter = sigma / epsilon_0
E_dielectric =field due to dielectric, Volts/meter = E_plates - E_effective
U = stored energy, Joules = 0.5 * C * V * V

// parallel capacitors
C_total = total capacitance = C1 + C2 + ... + Cn
Voltage across all capacitors is the same (V, battery voltage).
Charge on each is given by Qi = Ci * V, where Ci is capacitance of an individual capacitor and V is the battery voltage

// series capacitors
C_total = 1 / ( 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... + 1/Cn )
Each capacitor has the same plate charge, Q = C_total * V.
The voltage across an individual capacitor Ci is given by: Vi = Q / Ci.

// combinations of series and parallel capacitors
Apply rules for parallel and series capacitors, treating portions of the circuit as a single capacitor.

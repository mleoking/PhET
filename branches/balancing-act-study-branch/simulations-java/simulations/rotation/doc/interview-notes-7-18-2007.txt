some pswing components are fuzzy
reset all doesn't reset Angle readouts
label time axis "time (s)"
entering a value in the ang. vel. box and pressing return doesn't work properly
angular position readouts not updating during arrow drag when paused
|accel| is wrong color
typing in a box without pressing enter should work

how should update mode be set based on typing in text boxes?
maybe "angular acceleration" graph should be called "angle"
typing in the value for ang. accel, then pressing "go" reset the value to 0.0

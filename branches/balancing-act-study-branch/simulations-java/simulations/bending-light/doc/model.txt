Model for Bending Light

The bending light model uses Snell's Law at each interface for computing reflected/refracted angle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell's_law

The reflected/refracted light powers are calculated using the Fresnel Equations for "s-polarized" (perpendicular) light: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations

When showing multiple reflections in the Prism Break tab, light rays are terminated after 50 reflections/refractions to ensure computability.

To compute the white-light representation, the light ray paths are rasterized according to the Bresenham Line algorithm, and individual rays are added up, increasing both the intensity
and saturating the wavelength to make it appear whiter.  White light is actually depicted as gray to make the sim work against a white background.

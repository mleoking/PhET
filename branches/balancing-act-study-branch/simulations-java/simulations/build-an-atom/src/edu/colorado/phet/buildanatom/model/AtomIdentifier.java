/**
 * This class identifies and classifies atoms based on their configuration of
 * protons, neutrons, and electrons.  It is common functionality that is used
 * by a number of different classes that represent atoms, which is why it was
 * separated out.  The intent is that this be used by the atom classes
 * themselves so that clients of the atom classes can get the needed
 * information from directly from them, rather than using this class as a sort
 * of "3rd party expert".
 * <p/>
 * Information used within this class was gathered from a number of sources,
 * but the bulk came from the National Institute of Standards Technology
 * (NIST) web site.  The original data is preserved in a set of data
 * structures, and the various information is pulled from them either at run
 * time or is pre-processed into a more rapidly accessible format at init
 * time.

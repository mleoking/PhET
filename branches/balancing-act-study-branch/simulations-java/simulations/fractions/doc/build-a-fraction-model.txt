Build a fraction has two main game types: building with "Numbers" and building with "Cards", and each of these types of game mode can be played in three ways:
1. On the "Build a Fraction" tab with simple fractions
2. On the "Mixed Numbers" tab with mixed numbers.
3. On the "Fractions Lab" tab, the user can mix and match both types of representations.

When building with shapes, there are two representations: bars and pies.  These shapes were chosen because they easily
divide up into any number of divisions (in contrast, say, a five-pointed star only divides up into 5 or 10 parts nicely).

For mixed numbers, the fraction part may not be improper.  For example, three and four thirds is not a mixed fraction.  Nor is three and three thirds.

Different algorithms are used for challenge generation.  Sometimes the fraction values are generated first and matching pattern types are selected.
In other cases, the pattern types are chosen first and matching fraction values are selected.

The level descriptions are given in the source code in:
ShapeLevelList
NumberLevelList
MixedNumbersShapeLevelList
MixedNumbersNumberLevelList

ShapeLevelList declares a postprocessor in the method addWithPostprocessing which resamples from the level until finding one that has a small number of stacks and a small number of cards per stack.
MixedNumbersNumberLevelList declares a postprocessor in the method withDifferentRepresentations which attempts to find a level with different shape types

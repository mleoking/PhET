The <code>com.jme3.light</code> package contains various lights that can be placed
in a scene.
<p>
There are 3 types of lights currently supported in jMonkeyEngine:
<ul>
    <li>Point Light - Point lights emit from a certain location and have a certain influence radius (optional)</li>
    <li>Directional Light - Directional lights will always appear to emit from a certain direction
    regardless of an object's position</li>
    <li>Ambient Light - Ambient lights have no location or direction; 
        they simply emit a constant color that is applied to the entire scene</li>
</ul>

PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
August 22nd, 2011

Time period covered: August 17th through August 22nd.  Note that this is 4 work days instead of the usual 5 due to a change in the meeting schedule.

Balance and Torque - 7.0 hrs

•	Enlarged the level indicators.
•	Removed the prototype code for alternative level indicators.
•	Fixed issue with the rotational stopping point.
•	Made ruler transparent.
•	Removed tick marks from ruler and put "meters" label at bottom.
•	Reviewed with design team & brainstormed road map and next steps.
•	Fixed bug where masses could be placed in the same location on the plank.
•	Changed the mass labels for the shape masses to be two lines and enlarged the font.

Gene Expression Basics - 15.0 hrs

•	Fixed an issue with nodes returning to the tool box.
•	Made hints work for transcription factors.
•	Created a utility for creating random shapes within certain constraints, used for creating transcription factor shapes.
•	Made 2nd and 3rd biomolecule tool boxes have different transcription factors.
•	Added random walk motion to non-attached biomolecules.
•	Added the ability for biomolecules to find and move towards attachment sites on the DNA molecule.
•	Got attachment/detachment of biomolecules basically working.
•	Reviewed with Mike K, wrote up and circulated notes.

Molecule Polarity - 1.0 hr

•	Prototyped a rotation cursor (which turned out to be unnecessary, since Noah P was already creating one).

Environment - 1.0 hr

•	Made some changes to the DRK-12 spreadsheet based on feedback from the weekly meeting.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.5 hrs

•	Weekly status report.
•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Reviewed, prioritized, and updated Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave

•	Planning to take the Friday before Labor day (September 2nd).

What’s Next

•	Continue developing Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue developing Balance & Torque simulation.
•	Continue developing States of Matter: Basics.
•	Tackle a couple of installer issues.

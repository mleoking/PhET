o	Added beaker and thermometer.
o	Fixed issue with water not turning off and disappearing when faucet swapped out.
o	Got energy chunks to transfer into and out of the beaker on the heater element.
o	Made energy chunks on the incandescent light bulb become thermal before radiating out as light.
o	Made beaker lose energy more rapidly as temperature increases so that it never reaches the boiling point.
o	Made faucet knob bigger.
o	Reviewed with Noah P.
o	Changed thermal energy chunks to use black E's for consistency with other energy chunks.
o	Changed layout in support of translation.

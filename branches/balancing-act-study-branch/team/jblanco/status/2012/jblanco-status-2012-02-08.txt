February 8th, 2012

Time period covered: February 2nd through February 8th

Gene Expression - 19.5 hrs

-	Met with George E and tweaked the model for greater responsiveness.
-	Changed the cells on 2nd tab to use a brighter green when protein level at max (requested by Mike K).
-	Integrated a real picture of fluorescing E. coli.
-	Searched for other fluorescent E. coli pictures and sent out emails requesting their use.  No responses yet.
-	Created a logarithmic parameter control and integrated it into the last tab to get greater responsiveness.
-	Fixed an issue with the cell sizes when zoomed out on first tab.
-	Added play/pause button to last tab (requested by Mike K).
-	Attended an interview, conducted by Emily, on this simulation.
-	Discussed results of interviews with Julia and Emily.
-	Made hints brighter and more apparent, made them appear over all other elements in the view.
-	Reduced the number of some of the biomolecules in the toolbox from three to two to avoid false connection to number of proteins.
-	Fixed and issue with the interaction between polymerase and DNA that could cause the spreading effect to be greatly exaggerated.
-	Made the transcription factor move away from the DNA strand if dropped on top of one already on the strand.
-	Added some positive feedback for the completion of the protein collection.
-	Published versions for Mike K's web cast and for various interviews.

Balancing Act - 2.5 hrs

-	Met with Min Chi and Howard Palmer to discuss the data that is sent by the simulation.

Sim Sharing and Data Collection - 6.5 hrs

-	Met with Sam R to discuss the data processing code and how it could be used for or by Min Chi in her study.
-	Discussed server upgrade, updated associated ticket.
-	Discussed Min's needs for collecting data on the server, logged in ticket #3152.
-	Worked with Sam on load testing of the sim sharing database.

Installers - 2.5 hrs

-	Resolved an issue where the installer build date on the web site was not updated when Sam R manually built the installer, see #3249.
-	Updated the notebook that describes how to use the installer builder.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.5 hrs

-	Weekly status meeting.
-	Weekly status report.
-	Logged January hours in spreadsheet, filled out vacation and sick leave form.

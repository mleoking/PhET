John Blanco
February 1st, 2012

Time period covered: January 26th through February 1st.

Gene Expression - 23.5 hrs

-	Implemented a "separating axis test" in order to make the placement of the cells on the last tab happen more quickly (this was adding several seconds to the startup time).
-	Made the proteins larger.
-	Made the wording clearer that the it is the type of protein that is being collected.
-	Changed the labels for transcription factors to use words rather than + and - symbols.
-	Changed the layout of the biomolecule toolbox to make users more likely to start with positive transcription factor and use the negative one last.
-	Adjusted parameter ranges and scale of graph 3rd tab to try to make changes more apparent.
-	Optimized the placement of the cells on the last tab, since layout was taking as much as 8 seconds during startup.
-	Made the DNA change shape when being transcribed.
-	Contacted people about using images of GFP in E. Coli in the sim.
-	Met with Kathy P. to discuss the design of the 2nd tab.
-	Added better hint for collecting the proteins.

Sim Sharing and Data Collection - 6.0 hrs

-	Discussed issues concerning data processing using Scala.
-	Worked with Sam R to try to resolve issues with the database that were causing issues with the Dallas study.
-	Worked on backup of sim sharing DB, see #3227.  Able to mount the phetbackup network drive and have a backup command that works.  Next step is to automate.

Energy Skate Park Basics - 2.5 hrs

-	Code review and testing.

Balancing Act - 1.0 hrs

-	Discussed data collection via email with the Stanford group, set up meeting to discuss.

Customer Support - 1.0 hrs

-	Discussed metadata with JO, contacted Oregon Virtual School District (OVSD) people about the possibility of using it to keep their site up to date.
-	Wrote up summary of work performed over the last year for OVSD.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

-	Weekly status meeting.
-	Weekly status report.

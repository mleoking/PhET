PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
February 16th, 2012

Time period covered: February 9th through February 15th

Gene Expression - 22.0 hrs

-	Drew up proposal for 2nd tab and put the static picture into the sim for review.
-	Finished positive feedback for when all proteins produced.
-	Contacted Tom Perkins and Mike Klymkowsky about pictures of bacteria fluorescing.  No luck so far.
-	Met with Mike K to review progress, discuss design of 2nd tab.
-	Discussed presenting interview data to Mike K with the postdocs who have conducted interviews.
-	Fixed case where polymerase is transcribing and there is something already on the strand (the other thing gets knocked off).
-	Made it easier for the polymerase to get started if the user releases it near the correct spot.
-	Fixed a bug where two polymerases couldn't transcribe at one time.
-	Made one of the proteins generated on the 1st tab match the fluorescent color used in the last tab for a potential connection between the two.
-	Fixed some issues with having polymerase start to transcribe when it wanders to the correct location on its own (instead of being put there).
-	Made the random walk on the DNA strand move faster and detach sooner.
-	Made the ribosomes larger, since in reality they are substantially bigger than the polymerase.
-	Fixed bug with graph on 3rd tab that was causing occasional discontinuities.
-	Tried logarithmic scale for graph on 3rd tab, reverted it in favor of a higher resolution graph with more a more limited range for the protein level.

Balancing Act - 3.5 hrs

-	Made mystery object include label and instance information in their user component messages so that they can be uniquely identified.
-	Enabled the student ID dialog.
-	Added earned score to sim sharing messages from the game.
-	Published a version, sent link to Min C for review.  Haven't received a response yet.

Sim Sharing and Data Collection - 4.0 hrs

-	Ran a test to see if last message actually made it to the DB during our testing.  Turns out it did, which is good.  See #3250.
-	Worked with Sam R, Mike D, and Doug J on choosing the new server hardware and finding a location for it.

Fractions - 3.0 hrs

-	Worked with Sam R on refactoring model to be immutable.

Math Sims - 1.0 hr

-	Met with Ariel to discuss work on upcoming math simulations.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 7.0 hrs

-	Weekly status meeting.
-	Weekly status report.
-	Review, prioritization, and updating of Unfuddle issues.
-	Normal email and administrative overhead.

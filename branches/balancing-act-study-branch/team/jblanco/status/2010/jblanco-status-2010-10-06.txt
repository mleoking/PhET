Build an Atom - 16.5 hrs (much of this in collaboration with Sam R)

•	Added movement of electron from outer to inner shell if inner shell electron is removed.
•	Added Reset All button and got it working.
•	Met with chem group to review progress & discuss changes.
•	Added algorithm to make the nucleus reconfigure when nucleons are added.
•	Made the electrons stack up in a smaller space so that they look better.
•	Set background color to exact match with many of the Flash sims.
•	Made the pile of particles appear to "fall down" if a user removes a lower one and leaves upper ones dangling.
•	Published an initial version where the atom construction works to dev, rolled in first round of feedback, and then published another version.
•	Incorporated MaximizeControlNode from the Advanced Acid and Base sim.
•	Added first cut of the symbol indicator.

Neuron - 4.0 hrs

•	Added caption to sim speed control.
•	Added "Grip Indents" to the cursor on the membrane potential chart.
•	Sent out screen shots for various "grip indent" positions and solicited opinions on preferences.
•	Published version to dev for review.

Installers - 13.0 hrs

•	Resolved an issue where the KSU installer was failing to build.  This turned out to be a limitation of the BitRock installer, and means that the translated JAR files can't be included.

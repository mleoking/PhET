August 25, 2010

Note: Due to a shift in the PhET meeting time, this report covers the period from Aug 17 through Aug 25, 2010, which is nine calendar days instead of the usual 7.

Membrane Diffusion - 44.5 hrs

•	Finished implementing the ability to remove gates from the membrane.
•	Implemented animation of membrane channels returning to tool box.
•	Made particles abort membrane traversal if membrane channel removed during traversal.
•	Made movement of particles across the membrane the same for both particle types.
•	Split the tool box into two (one for leak channels and one for gated channels) as depicted in the spec.
•	Added handling for the case where the membrane is fill - displays dialog to user.
•	Added limit for number of particles and handling for case when container is full.
•	Added ability to clear all particles from the chamber.
•	Scaled the charts to always be able to handle the max number of particles.
•	Prototyped ability to handle multiple particles through the channel and to handle collisions inside the channel.  After review with Noah P, we decided that this is unneeded and have since removed it.
•	Replaced "fake Hodgkin-Huxley model" that was left over from initial leveraging from Neuron sim with a simpler and more appropriate model.
•	Changed look of selector for particle injector.
•	Made the buttons toggle the state of the channels and also their text and appearance.
•	Fixed several issues related to cursor behavior by creating custom cursors.
•	Cleaned up code to remove unused code and any other elements left over from the Neuron sim.
•	Profiled for memory leaks, found and fixed a couple.
•	Published a version for review and potentially for student interviews.
•	Reviewed with Noah P (twice).

Inside Magnets - 2.5 hrs

•	Got Gary Wysin’s "rotor" sim to compile and run on a Windows platform, which required setting up X11 using Cygwin.

Common Code - 0.5 hrs

•	Participated in discussion about etched borders.
•	Worked with Chris M on some potential changes to the CursorHandler class in common code.

Miscellaneous - 0.5

•	Checked the Unfuddle guest account to make sure the password hasn't been changed.
•	Verified that the SVN mirror process is working correctly on phet-server.

Process Improvement - 2.0

•	Participated in developer meeting to discuss potential improvements to development process.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Will be out on Thursday and Friday of next week, September 2nd & 3rd (yet another wedding in Canada).

What’s Next

•	Work with Noah P to finalize Membrane Diffusion and support interviews on it.
•	Make any other changes that result from interviews on Neuron.
•	Finalize photon absorption tab on Greenhouse, support any interviews on it.
•	Make some minor UI changes to the control panel on the 2nd tab of the Greenhouse sim.
•	Start on next sim.

Greenhouse - 29.0 hrs

•	Added the ability to select the different molecules.
•	Made the atom colors match those used in PhET for greater consistency.
•	Implement initial oscillation modes for all molecules that capture photons.
•	Made reset work for returning to default settings in the model.
•	Resolved issue with upside-down molecules on control panel.
•	Made the control panel evenly spaced for all molecules.
•	Fixed issues with the operation of the control panel.
•	Published a version and solicited feedback on the first cut of vibrational modes.
•	Created different images (a flashlight and a heat lamp) to distinguish between the different types of photons being emitted.
•	Fixed bond structure for N2O based on feedback from Robert P.
•	Fixed bond structure for N2 and O2 based on feedback from Kelly L.
•	Created and incorporated icons for Earth and Venus.

Common Code - 3.0 hrs

•	Worked on issue where images are clipped, see Unfuddle #558.

Investigated JMOL - 2.0 hrs

•	Collaborated with Sam to download the code, integrate it with Piccolo, and get a simple app working that puts a molecule on a canvas.

Environment - 1.0

•	Installed Intellij and got it configured.  This was done to aid in collaborating with Sam and so I can become somewhat familiar with it.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting
•	Annual performance review meeting
•	Set up better filtering for email messages.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0.0 hrs

•	Upcoming vacation from July 29 - August 10

What’s Next

•	Determine if air should be implemented for Greenhouse and, if so, clarify the behavior and implement.
•	Support student interviews on Neuron.
•	Continue port to Piccolo of existing tabs in Greenhouse.
•	Continue work on Membrane Diffusion sim.

PhET Weekly Progress Report

KSU Installer - 10.0

•	Started migrating this to Figaro, since having this installer builder on Tigercat is causing us to exceed disk usage quota.
•	Worked with Figaro support to install HTTrack (the web site ripper) on Figaro.
•	Did initial implementation of two-pass installer creation in order to have the local mirror installers contained within the web-hostable mirror installer.  This is about 85% implemented and not yet tested.
•	Incorporated new URL from which the translated web site will be extracted, since Jonathan O has moved the site.
•	Investigated incorporation of the distribution tag, still having email discussions on this issue.
•	Participated in discussions about whether the sims hosted by KSU should send stats to our server of whether we should rely on KSU to provide the stats.

Neuron - 10.0

•	Discussed changes to particle motion with Noah P and implemented a motion gradient that should allow for some atoms to be in the center of the cross section.
•	Revised color scheme to match that which is currently recommended by Wendy and Noah (note that this may change after the IPHY people see it).
•	Implemented a base class for membrane channels.
•	Partially implemented first cut of a sodium leakage channel in both the model and view.  Channels now appear on the membrane, but atoms are not yet crossing the membrane.
•	Discussed learning goals with Noah P.

Radioactive Dating Game – 7.0 hrs

•	Increased the granularity of the data on the chart that is used for radiometric dating so that each age would have a unique value for percentage of element remaining.  Did some optimizations so that this change would not increase time required to switch between dating elements.
•	Moved object/air selector to the bottom of the meter (Requested by Noah P after interviews)
•	Made the half-life selection box on the meter only visible when "Custom Nucleus" selected on the meter (Requested by Noah P after interviews).
•	Moved the growing tree to the right to be closer to the "Plant Tree" button. (Requested by Noah P after interviews).
•	Made the names of all datable items into translatable strings (since they are now visible to users).
•	Published to the production web site!

Web Site and (non-KSU) Installer - 4.0 hrs

•	Revised the content and appearance of the research page based on requests from Wendy A.
•	Cropped and reposted picture team.
•	Investigated failure of weekly installer build, fixed issue and manually rebuilt and redeployed the installers.

Alpha & Beta Decay - 3.0 hrs

•	Fixed an issue with the Y-axis label on the 2nd tab of Alpha Decay.
•	Performed regression testing in preparation for deployment (also did basic regression testing on Nuclear Fission flavor).
•	Published to the production web site.

Miscellaneous - 1.0

•	Worked with Tigercat support to resolve some issues with interaction between outbound filtering and SVN.
•	Investigated getting a UPS for phet-server.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

PhET Weekly Progress Report

Lac Operon Sim - 24.0 hrs

•	Finished implementing the ability to add items to the play area from the tool bar.
•	Implemented "snap into place" for items that go on the DNA strand and are placed nearby.
•	Implemented "return to tool box" for items that are moved from the tool box into the simulation but are placed at an illegal location.  The return is not currently animated, but may be in the future.
•	Made things that are removed from the tool box appear as outlines.
•	Made the appropriate location on the DNA strand light up when the user grabs the matching piece from the tool box.
•	Implemented the "Reset All" functionality, including addition of the button.
•	Met with Noah P to review current state and future plans, implemented several changes based on this meeting, including:
o	Made mRNA transcription move away from DNA more clearly.
o	Changed order of items in the tool box.
o	Added a speed control slider.
o	Tweaked location where RNA polymerase transcribes the DNA.
o	Removed the currently unused 2nd tab.
o	Modified to have two RNA Polymerase molecules in existence at startup.
•	Implemented the Lactose Injector node and part of its functionality (in progress).
•	This sim is close to being ready to show to Jared Taylor and others for some initial feedback.

Atomic Interactions - 4.0 hrs

•	Implemented a "wiggle me" to prompt users to move the atom.  This was based on feedback from Kelly L's interviews.
•	Added code to reposition the adjustable atoms when they are resized so that they don't shoot off the screen.  This was based on feedback from Kelly L's interviews.
•	Met with Noah P to review and make some additional tweaks to the wiggle me.
•	Published for review, received some feedback, updated, and published again.

Radioactive Dating Game Sim - 3.0

•	Integrated a new probe image from Noah P.  This one was arrived at after some review of the other possible images.
•	Investigated implementation of a proximity algorithm for positioning of the probe, so that the user doesn't have to actually touch the probe to the datable items.  Decided against this for now - doesn't seem worth the effort.
•	Published to dev for review and feedback.
•	Regression testing of all flavors of sims in the Nuclear Physics project.
•	Published to production server in time to be used by Ingrid Reid's Earth Sciences class.
•	Fixed an issue where the graph on the 2nd tab would run when no nuclei were present, and redeployed.

Custom Installers - 1.5 hrs

•	Tested ripping of UTF-8 and UTF-16 JNLP files to see if this could explain why the rip of the wicket web site takes so long.  It did not, so this is still a bit of a mystery.
•	Did a small amount of testing of KSU's mirror site, which is now up and running using the latest KSU custom installer.  So far it all looks good.

Build Process - 1.5 hrs

•	Worked with the rest of the development team to try to track down issues that occurred while deploying Nuclear Physics to the production server.

Miscellaneous - 2.0 hrs

•	Fixed problem described in ticket #89 for States of Matter and Nuclear Physics.
•	Supported Marj in redeploying the common strings.  We once again ran into the disk quota issue on Tigercat, so this attempt was only partially successful.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 4.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

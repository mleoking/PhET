Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign - 10.0 hrs

•	Added a dynamic pie chart to the time chart on multi-nucleus tab that changes as nuclei decay.
•	Made the half life line move when switching between nuclei to make it more noticeable.
•	Made the adjustment arrow on the half life line larger, changed color of half life marker.
•	Made the energy lines on the 2nd tab move when switching between nuclei to make them more noticeable.
•	Captured some screen shots and tested them for color blindness visibility, changed the Polonium label back to yellow based on the results.
•	Limited the "tunneling radius" for alpha particles so that wouldn't appear to be tunneling out of the nucleus when the tunneling radius was large.
•	Published new versions to dev site and solicited feedback.

Installer & Web Site – 8.0 hrs

•	Implemented installer code that logs the most recent installer creation date into the database.
•	Removed some old installer code for modifying flash files that did not appear to be used.
•	Started on creating PHP code to automatically sign JAR files.

Code Signing Certificate - 8.0 hrs

•	Finished providing proof of PhET's legitimacy to Comodo and have obtained the digital signing certificate.
•	Tested signing simulations, sent out a version that included an installer for testing.
•	Started working on automated JAR signing.

Requirements and Test Plan for IOM Milestone – 4.0 hrs

•	Cleaned up introductory sections.
•	Reviewed with Kathy P and revised it based on her input.

Common Code - 1.5

•	Verified issues 1130 and 1190, which are related to sending statistics data collected when sims are run in a situation where the Internet is not available (and becomes available later).

Meetings & Email - 6.5 hrs

•	Get the test plan in shape for Alpha Testing.
•	Create a version of the installer for Alpha Testing.
•	Work with Marj to get several laptops set up with different versions of browser, Java, etc. for alpha testing.
•	Start on implementation of Heterogeneous Interaction Potential.

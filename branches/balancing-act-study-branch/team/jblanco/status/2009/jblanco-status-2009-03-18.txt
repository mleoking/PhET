IOM Alpha Testing – 8.0 hrs

•	Worked with Sam to devise and implement a scheme to track resolution of failed alpha tests.
•	Went through the Common Code Test Results DB/spreadsheet and fixed any entry errors (arduous, but necessary).

•	Followed up on each reported failure of Alpha-2 test cases (29 in all).
•	Published test coverage report for the Alpha testing, will review at this week’s meeting.

Common Code – 8.0 hrs

•	Finished initial cut of OrphanStringChecker utility, published report. Unfuddle #1108. (An "Orphan String" is a string that is in the English localization file but not used in the sim).
•	Cleaned up orphan strings for SOM, Nukes, and all of the sims created by Ron LeMaster.
•	Worked with Sam and Chris to support cleanup of orphan strings in other sims.
•	Enhanced TestCoverageChecker to output test coverage information in a format that can be easily imported into a spreadsheet.
•	Verified and closed issues that were resolved by other developers.

Heterogeneous Interaction Potential – 8.0 hrs

•	Started implementing support for heterogeneous particles in the underlying model (in collaboration with Sam).
•	Started implementing the new control panel.

States of Matter – 6.0 hrs

•	Made the adjustable-interaction-strength atoms start at a warmer temperature.
•	Modified the phase diagram and interaction potential diagram so that the close button doesn't overlap and thus hide information (Unfuddle 1481).

Installer & Web Site – 4.0 hrs

•	Worked on getting the web site ripper to rip a single sim.  Part of tickets 1154 & 1155.

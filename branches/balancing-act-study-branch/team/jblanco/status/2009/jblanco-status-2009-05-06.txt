Radiometric Dating Game – 17.5 hrs

•	Added ability to decay to nuclei on 2nd tab (Carbon->Nitrogen).
•	Added better spatial distribution algorithm to 2nd tab.
•	Met with Noah P and Kathy P to get some input from Kathy.
•	Implemented various aspects of the chart that depicts proportion of nuclei decayed as a function of time.

Neuron Sim – 2.0 hrs

•	Met with Noah P, Wendy A, and Jonathan O to discuss design and clarify our collective understanding.

Atomic Interactions Sim (formerly known as Heterogeneous Interaction Potential) – 1.5 hrs

•	Renamed the sim and posted it to dev for review, requested feedback.

Common Code – 5.0 hrs

•	Worked with Sam to fix an issue with Balloons so that it could be used for testing the update feature, posted the sim to production web site (#1614).
•	Tested various upgrade scenarios.
•	Worked on an issue with slider knobs not appearing for some sims when run on Macs (#1617).

Installer & Web Site – 8.0 hrs

•	Removed code for handling IOM transition, since transition is now complete (#1572).
•	Added link to notebook containing information about manually building the installers to the menu items in PBG.
•	Rebuilt and tested the installers in order to incorporate the new version of balloons sim.
•	Tested that update scenario worked from the installer by using old installer and verifying that the balloons sim informed me of an update.
•	Worked on issues related to permissions.  These were found during testing and required code to specifically change permissions of ripped/generated files at several stages of the process so that other users aren't blocked from building installers (#1154).
•	Set up cron job to test overnight build (prior to fully reinstating the weekly build).

Development Environment - 1.0

•	Set up "Big Mac" with latest version of Eclipse and latest code base and got it working well enough to work on problem with sliders.

Greenhouse - 11.0 hrs

•	Fixed problem where thermometer was not visible on 2nd tab (#1118).
•	Fixed a problem where a black bar and another green or brown bar were visible on the lower portion of the play area (#1127).
•	Fixed a problem where the sim was running out of memory due to image allocations (#417, #1079).
•	Investigated but did not resolve issue with "jumpy painting" when switching tabs.  Conclusion was that fix would take too long and was not justified given the small benefit.
•	Deployed new version to the production server.

Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign - 7 hrs

•	Removed the "Clear Chart" button from the first tab.
•	Extended the half life line down to the label and made the color a brighter, more eye-catching red.

•	Renamed the sim from Alpha Radiation to Alpha Decay and updated all strings appropriately.
•	Deployed to the production server.

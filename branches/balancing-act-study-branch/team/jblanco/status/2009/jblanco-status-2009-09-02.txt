•	Revised wording and layout of the age guessing dialog to make it clearer to students what they should do.
•	Fixed an issue with the look of the graph when air is being measured for Carbon 14 over a long time scale.
•	Moved the initial position of the dating probe so that it will initially be on the datable item (tree or rock) in the measurement tab.
•	Published to dev in support of more interviews.

Miscellaneous - 2.0

•	Worked with Trish on enabling her to access the Big Mac for via VNC for testing.
•	Set up the Big Mac with a static IP address, updated the relevant Unfuddle notebook.

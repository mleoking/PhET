Radiometric Dating Game – 26.0 hrs

•	Implemented the actual "Dating Game" functionality, which allows the users to guess the age of each datable item.
•	Got the proportions chart on the Dating Game tab to work for Uranium 238 as well as Carbon 14.
•	Fixed issues with size and positioning of labels on pie chart on 2nd tab.
•	Finished the chart on the first tab, including labels for the time axis, labels for isotopes, etc.
•	Refactored to use a single nucleus type and collection of display information.  This should improve maintainability and make it easier to implement the next flavor (which is Beta Decay, I think).
•	Started on implementation of new tab for demonstrating measurement of individual items after they begin to radiometrically age.
•	Published a version for review and solicited feedback.

Atomic Interactions - 8.0

•	Implemented change to allow atoms to overlap when they collide.
•	Implemented change to make the atoms appear to have fuzzy boundaries.
•	Fixed an issue where the centers of the atoms were not correctly lined up with the potential graph.
•	Reviewed with Mike D and incorporated his feedback.

Installer & Web Site – 3.0 hrs

•	Updated flyer for upcoming conference (requested by Trish L).
•	Looked into increasing the disk quota on Tigercat.  Cost is $100/mo for substantially more space (up to 50GB).
•	Corrected some file permission issues pointed out by Jonathan O, investigated and implemented long term (I hope) fix.
•	Helped Marj to resolve some permission issues that she was having.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 3.0 hrs

•	Completed the online Information Security training.
•	Maintaining and updating unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Miscellaneous Notes

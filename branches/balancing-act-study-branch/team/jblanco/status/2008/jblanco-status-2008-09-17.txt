States of Matter Sim - 29.5 hrs

•	Worked on tracking down and correcting the "jerky" behavior that is occasionally seen.  A possible fix has been implemented and the behavior as not been seen since.
•	Added ability to enabled viewing of separate attractive and repulsive forces to the Interaction Potential tab.
•	Made phase diagram behavior to be non-linear, since this is more real.
•	Corrected wording and labels on the Interaction Potential diagrams based on feedback from meetings.
•	Removed the gravity control slider (it is now available on developer controls if needed).
•	Incorporated improved icons from Noah P. for depicting the state selections on the first tab.
•	Fixed a "conservation of energy" issue that was causing odd behavior on the Interaction Potential tab.
•	Added ability to recalculate and adjust force vectors even if sim is paused.
•	Added Neon to the Interaction Potential tab and removed monatomic oxygen (requested by Paul B).
•	Improved the "gray out" behavior of the slider controls based on feedback from meeting.
•	Calibrated scaling factors for pressure and temperature for better mapping to phase diagram and for more realistic behavior.
•	Implemented code to use Isokinetic thermostat when temperature is changing and Anderson when temperature is stable.

Common Code - 2 hrs

•	Worked with Sam R. on creating new and improved play/pause buttons.

Nuclear Physics - 1.0

•	Changed the name of the simulation that shows fission from Nuclear Physics to Nuclear Fission.
•	Deployed Nuclear Fission and Alpha Radiation sims to dev and solicited feedback.

Web Site - 1.0

•	Worked with Kathy to get licensing links and wording updated based on feedback from Hewlett.


Meetings & Email - 2.5 hrs

•	Regular weekly status meeting.
•	Various discussions with Noah P, Paul B, Sam R, and Kathy in person and via email.

Tools and Infrastructure - 4.0 hrs

•	Got the PHP tools for Eclipse installed and working.  This should make web fixes go faster.
•	Updated PC with service pack 3 and latest Java version.
•	Studied Java class "GridBagLayout" and "GridBagContraints" to allow me to do better layout of controls on control panels.

Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign - 25.5 hrs

•	Implemented the time chart for the 2nd tab, including Polonium mode (linear) and an exponential time line for the adjustable nucleus.
•	Implemented configurability in the energy chart.
•	Improved resizing of the energy graph on the 2nd tab, since it was looking ragged at low screen resolutions.
•	Reviewed latest version with Noah P.
•	Updated image licensing information.

States of Matter Sim - 3 hrs

•	Put together a plan and estimate for changes to the 2nd tab (Phase Changes) requested by Noah P.  These changes revolve around having a configurable molecule on this tab.
•	Updated image licensing information.

Installer & Web Site - 0.5 hrs

•	Verified that the automatically built installer correctly creates the marker file.

JAR Signing (Unfuddle issue #909) - 2 hrs

•	Wrote up a summary of findings and sent to Kathy and Wendy, awaiting response.

Meetings & Email - 5 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Normal email overhead.

Miscellaneous - 6 hr

•	Got the new office cleaned; organized and executed the move.

Upcoming Work

•	Get a decision on SOM changes and implement them if approved.
•	Get SOM tested and deploy latest version to production server.
•	Continue implementation of Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign.  Major next steps are making the energy chart affect half life and propagate it to model and other chart, implementing the smaller bucket on the 1st tab.
•	Try accounting for gravitational potential energy in SOM (limit to 2 hrs).
•	Work on signing JAR files and Windows EXE files.
•	Work on Unfuddle issues that are assigned to me.

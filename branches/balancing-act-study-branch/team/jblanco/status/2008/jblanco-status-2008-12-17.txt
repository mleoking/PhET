Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign - 20.0 hrs

•	Finished implementing the ability to adjust the half life based on relative energy levels.
•	Made total energy able to go negative on energy chart.
•	Rearranged exponential time line to put textual labels underneath.
•	Implemented the ability to pause the model while energy levels are adjusted.
•	Fixed the alpha particles on the energy graph so that they move with energy levels and are correctly reset when nucleus type changes.
•	Enlarged the energy graph to provide the user with greater resolution of the half life control.
•	Added milliseconds to the time line.
•	Added infinity indication when energy lines are set such that half life is infinite.
•	Corrected the labels on the time chart Y axis for the configurable nucleus.
•	Made the nuclei in the bucket smaller so that it is clearer that they are ‘different’ from the ones that are decaying on the canvas.
•	Reviewed a couple of different versions with Noah P.

States of Matter Sim - 3.0 hrs

•	Added interaction potential graph back to the Phase Changes tab.
•	Added a new "Configurable" nucleus choice to the Phase Changes tab and implemented code in model and view to show it.

Installer & Web Site - 3.0 hrs

•	Worked with Marj on a problem with Alpha Decay translation.
•	Created a set of redirects for making URLs included in a soon-to-be-published paper shorter and more comprehensible.
•	Fixed an issue with the backup script where old backups were not being deleted.
•	Inquired about our disk usage quota on Tigercat (twice), no response received yet.

PhET Server - 5.0

•	Set up the new PhET server in my office, shut down the old one.
•	Created a mirror (i.e. backup) of the SVN repository and created a script for performing periodic resynchronizations.
•	Verified SVN mirror by checking out locally and building, and by browsing history logs.

JAR Signing (Unfuddle issue #909) - 2.0 hrs

•	Spoke with sales people at Verisign, got contact info, requested written quote for 2- and 3-year digital signing certificates.

Meetings & Email - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Normal email overhead.

Miscellaneous - 2.0 hrs

•	Finalized the setup of the new office.

Upcoming Work

•	Finish implementing the configurable attraction atom for SOM.
•	Get SOM tested and deploy latest version to production server.
•	Review Tabbed Alpha Decay with designers, do a bunch of testing, fix any issues that are standing in the way of interviews.
•	Try accounting for gravitational potential energy in SOM (limit to 2 hrs).
•	Start on the revised Interaction Potential sim.
•	Figure out when we will need to get signing certificate and start the ball rolling.
•	Work on Unfuddle issues that are assigned to me.

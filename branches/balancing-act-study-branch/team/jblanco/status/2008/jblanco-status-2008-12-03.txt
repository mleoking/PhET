Note: This report covers a two week period, from November 20 through December 3, due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign – 19.5 hrs

•	Got variable half life working.
•	Removed the slider from the Alpha Decay chart (during the last meeting we agreed to use handle on half-life line instead) and adjusted layout accordingly.
•	Made the Reset Nuclei button appear to be pressed when half life is changed.
•	Made the labels on the chart change based on nucleus type.
•	Made the nuclei images pregenerated on application startup to avoid a delay when switching between nucleus types for the first time.
•	Made the un-decayed nuclei jitter until they decay.
•	Changed color and sizing of labels for custom nuclei to make more readable.
•	Implemented the histogram-like piling up of the nuclei when they decay.
•	Tested on Mac to make sure it runs reasonably well so far.
•	Implemented the ability to switch between nucleus types on the 2nd tab.
•	Made the pre-decay nuclei on the time chart look like a bunch rather than a single nucleus.
•	Started on design and implementation plan for time chart on 2nd tab.
•	Changed the layout of the bottom graph on the 2nd tab to match the spec.  This is in preparation for adding adjustment handles to the graph.

States of Matter Sim - 8 hrs

•	Removed sliders from Interaction Potential tab when adjustable molecule is not selected.
•	Created and published a version with faster heating/cooling response to see if it was better.  This change was decided against after review by Noah P. and has been backed out.
•	Removed some code that was left over from when John De Goes had started on this sim.
•	Removed Interaction Potential chart from 2nd tab

Installer & Web Site – 9 hrs

•	Modified the installer builder scripts to generate tracking files (Unfuddle #875)
•	Made the installer builder automatically keep backups of the previous installers up to a fixed number of times, currently 4 (Unfuddle #564).
•	Removed some unused PHP code from the installer-builder scripts.
•	Checked for updates to the version of Java currently bundled with the installer, verified that we are still using the latest 1.5 version.
•	Set up a cron job to periodically clean out incomplete contributions (requested by Dano a while back).

JAR Signing (Unfuddle issue #909) - 8 hrs

•	Met with Chris and discussed the paper he wrote on the subject and explored other questions.
•	Researched the basis of how it works, gained an understanding of the tradeoffs.
•	Contacted several vendors (Verisign, Thawte, GlobalSign) and obtained quotes.

Infrastructure & Process - 1.5 hrs

•	Tested new GUI build application with Sam

Meetings & Email - 9 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Normal email overhead.

Misc - 1 hr

•	Got new office cleaned, started moving


Holiday and Vacation Time - 24 hrs

•	Nov 26 - Vacation day
•	Nov 27 & 28 - Holidays

Upcoming Work

•	Finish getting latest version of SOM testing and deploy it to the production server.
•	Continue implementation of Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign.  Major next steps are implementing the time chart on the 2nd tab and implementing the smaller bucket on the 1st tab.
•	Try accounting for gravitational potential energy in SOM (limit to 2 hrs).
•	Work on signing JAR files and Windows EXE files.

Nuclear Physics Sim - 16 hrs

* Incorporated Chris Malley's reusable thermometer into the Nuclear Reactor.
* Fixed an issue with the Alpha Radiation graph where it was not truly representing a 1/r relationship for potential energy.
* Fixed an issue where nodes beneath the atomic explosion, which were not visible, could be grabbed.
* Made default energy graphs on Nuclear Reactor tab default to being visible.
* Increased explosion threshold so containment must be enlarged before explosion will occur.
* Changed the nucleus behavior on the Fission Energy graph to "hop up" more quickly.

States of Matter Sim - 18.5 hrs

* Met again with Paul Beale to go over IDL implementation of Verlet algorithm of Lennard-Jones potential.
* Updated the existing simulation code conform to the current simulation design conventions.
* Studied the existing code in detail.
* Changed the canvas and model dimensions to model real units, in this case picometers.
* Converted Scaled Vector Graphic version of cup to a PNG image.

Web Site - 2 hrs

* Looked into options for modifying the install screens, will implement changes this week.
* Looked around for updated icons/logos that could be used for installer, got some pointers from Wendy.
* Updated unfuddle tickets.

Meetings - 2 hrs

* Regular weekly status meeting
* Various discussions with Kathy, Sam, & Chris in person and via email.

Tools and Infrastructure - 1.5 hrs

* Researched ways to increase my personal productivity by using Eclipse refactoring support and templates.

Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign – 18.5 hrs

•	Implemented the multi-nucleus model and made it handle the decay of multiple nuclei and the generation of alpha particles.
•	Added the ability to replace a nucleus extracted from the bucket (if the model has more capacity).
•	Implemented the "Add 10" button for adding large batches of nuclei at once.
•	Implemented the "Reset All Nuclei" capability to reset the nuclei that are placed in the play area.
•	Implemented the "Reset All" button with returns all nuclei to the bucket.
•	Made the bucket a part of the model for easier extraction and return of nuclei.
•	Continued overall design.

States of Matter Sim - 8 hrs

•	Implemented the ability to maintain state when switching between chemicals (requested by Trish and Noah).
•	Implemented diatomic and triatomic phase changer classes for setting the phase.
•	Implemented DiatomicVerletAlgorithm as part of refactoring effort.  Triatomic algorithm is next.

Installer & Web Site – 6 hrs

•	Checked with Orrie as to whether he was prepared for a possible traffic increase due to article in Science magazine.
•	Tested installer to verify that it was in good shape for anticipated surge.
•	Started investigating an issue with removal of individually installed JARs from Windows XP.
•	Continued interacting with "experts" via Microsoft forum for a solution to the Mark Of The Web + JNLP issue.
•	Updated the workshop page and associated materials.

Miscellaneous  - 0.5 hr

•	Verified Unfuddle ticket using the dual-boot Mac.

Meetings & Email - 7 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Group meeting on the way the update and tracking features should behave.
•	Discussion with Chris and Sam about updating sims that were installed via the full installer.
•	Normal email overhead.

Upcoming Work

•	Finish refactoring of SOM multi-particle model and perform thorough regression test.
•	Publish SOM.
•	Continue implementation of Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign.  Major next steps are implementing the custom nuclei, implementing the ability to return nodes to the bucket, implementing the adjustable half life, and making the graph work.
•	Work with Dano to resolve some other issues surrounding the launching of locally installed sims.

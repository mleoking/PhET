PhET Progress Report

States of Matter Sim - 19 hrs

•	Finished making the phase diagram track roughly to the demarcation lines.
•	Changed the dial gauge node to have an upper limit to prevent wildly large pressure values.
•	Created a new sim "flavor" for standalone interaction potential.
•	Implemented behavior for low temperatures (i.e. nearing absolute 0) by first implementing exponential decay, then actually allowing absolute zero.
•	Cleaned up the image gradients for Interaction Potential tab, including making it resize with atom size.
•	Cleaned up debug output.
•	Added credits.

Nuclear Physics - 4

•	Updated the teaching activities and other sim information for Alpha Decay and Nuclear Fission.
•	Deleted Nuclear Physics and put a redirect in place.
•	Fixed a naming/labeling issue with Alpha Decay and redeployed to the production server.
•	Added credits.

Common Code - 2 hrs

•	Added the ability to translate strings for the ColorChooser dialog.
•	Tested (at home) running the tracking/update prototype code to see how firewalls would respond.

Web Site – 9 hrs

•	Fixed a problem with the installer that was causing bad installer files to be generated (related to cutover to Unfuddle SVN server).
•	Made the flash redirects for the sims that changed names point to the sim page, not the sim itself.
•	Trained Marj on redirects and had her add them for the other (i.e. non-name-change) flash sims.
•	Created a shell script to make it easy to periodically create backups of working installers.
•	Started investigating issue where IE warns about many PhET pages when running installed version (Unfuddle 184).

Meetings & Email - 6 hrs

•	Regular weekly status meeting.
•	Sim tracking meeting.
•	Meeting with Sam and Chris to plan improvements to common code base.
•	Various discussions with Noah P, Chris M, Sam R, and Kathy in person and via email.

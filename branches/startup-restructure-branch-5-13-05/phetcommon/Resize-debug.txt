If I don't add a ResizeHandler to the ApparatusPanel2, we get the same problem. This says that it's not a problem with TransformManager, or any of the ApparatusPanel2 stuff.

It does the same thing if I use ApparatusPanel, rather than ApparatusPanel2.

Tried giving the ContentPanel a BorderLayout instead of GridBag. Same result.

Tried using a JSplitPane for the ApparatusPanel and ControlPanel. Same result.

ControlPanelTest6 suggests strongly that the problem is in ControlPanel. Look at the inner class TestModule.

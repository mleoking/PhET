- Double daughters in reactor


- Frame doesn't always come up completely until you resize it
- Performance is very much frame-size dependent
- Single fission panel should work differently: Nucleus should jump to higher level instantaneously. The necking should
vibrate without the CM moving
- Fission products should have same momentum, not speed
- "Slow Motion" button
- Make NucleusGraphic a PhetImageGraphic for performance?
- percent fisioned text field isn't right while nuclei are being added
- kabooms need to be on a layer above the containment vessel
- listeners and leaveSystem() implementations are spread around in odd places
- is more than one kaboom being made per fission?

I experimented with JFreechart's combined plots originally, see for example:
trunk\simulations-java\simulations\rotation\src\edu\colorado\phet\rotation\graphs\combined
in repository version 15358

This solution proved unsatisfactory for several reasons,
the main problems being about flexibility in layout, organization of data, and ability to override behavior.

The difficulty in manually lining up plots is worth the trouble to avoid jfreechart's implementation of combined plots.

For more, please see the test cases in:
trunk\simulations-java\simulations\rotation\src\edu\colorado\phet\rotation\tests\combined

Do we want to calculate the angular velocity of bug if user is manually moving it around?
    No.  Just don’t update it when user is manipulating bug.

( (JComponent)c ).setOpaque( false );
in PSwing appears to improve performance in rotation sim

Hi John, Paul, I hope this suffices:

Concerning the "rotor" simulation code that was developed while I was at 
University of Colorado as a Big 12 Faculty Fellow of Kansas State University 
in 2010, which depicts what happens to plane rotor magnetic dipoles inside a 
magnet with changing temperature and applied magnetic field, I hereby grant 
the PhET project full and free use of the "rotor" software that was developed 
solely by me. The PhET project may use this software as is, or may derive 
other work from it, without payment or licensing fees, provided that my 
authorship as a Kansas State University Big 12 Faculty Fellow is acknowledged 
in any published PhET software derived from the original rotor code.

Gary Wysin

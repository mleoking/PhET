Scala Eclipse Plugin 2.7.5.final (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94)
Eclipse "Classic" 3.4.2
Mac OS 10.5.7
Java 1.5.0_19


Things to test:
Open Hierarchy
Go to definition (F3)
Debugger
JProfiler

Things that  work:
HelloWorld example (though not all of the time)
Open Type
Open Resource

Things that DO NOT work:
Refactor->Rename (Java renames not propagated to Scala)
Refactor->Move (confused about both Java and Scala moves, can't move things back)
Source->Format
after checking out trunk as Scala Project, it never appeared in Package Explorer
completion (ctrl-SPACE)
attempting to run something with compile errors doesn't warning, simply runs previous compilation
after adding Scala Nature to a Java project, no Scala stuff in New menu
organize imports doesn't find Java classes in the project


Bugs:
New->Scala Object (dialog doesn't close after pressing Finish)

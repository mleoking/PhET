PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
March 30th, 2011

Time period covered: March 17th through March 30th (two weeks, due to vacation).

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 23.5 hrs

•	Changed the pie chart to always have the lightest element contained in the test chamber centered on the left side (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Added labels to pie chart.
•	Fixed issue where hydrogen state was not reset on Reset All.
•	Changed average atomic mass indicator to always show 5 digits.
•	Published a version for interviews.  This was requested by Kelly L.
•	Tested on Mac, duplicated issues that Chris M had pointed out, fixed one of them.
•	Added the ability to override the atomic mass value and the isotope proportions in the test chamber so that "Nature's Mix" will precisely match accepted values.
•	Various testing and fixing of minor user interface problems and behavioral bugs.

Build a Molecule - 3.0 hrs

•	Reviewed spec changes and updates.
•	Set up initial project space (in collaboration with Jonathan O.)
•	Put static drawings on each of the 3 tabs as a sort of "Fast Prototype" (in collaboration with Jonathan O.)

States of Matter - 1.0 hrs

•	Created, tested, and published a version that excludes the 3rd tab (Atomic Interactions).  This was requested by Emily M for use in interviews.

Sim Sharing - 0.5

•	Worked with IT folks to figure out why ports had not been opened.  Should be working now but still needs testing, see Unfuddle #2749.

Environment - 3.0

•	Supported Mike Dubson in his efforts to deploy updated Masses and Springs to the production server.
•	Discussion with Sam R and Chris M about best practices for model objects that come and go.

Customer Support – 2.0 hrs

•	Supported David Chavez of Pearson with an issue about Flash sims displaying "KeyNotFound" in some cases.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 7.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Weekly status report.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

•	Took March 21st through March 24th as vacation.
•	March 25th was a university holiday.

What’s Next

•	Continue refining design of Build a Molecule simulation.
•	Continue implementation of Build a Molecule simulation.
•	Finish implementing Isotopes sim, publish versions for review and possibly for interviews.
•	Follow up on Chris M's review of Molecules & Light code.
•	Work on design of Protein Synthesis sim.

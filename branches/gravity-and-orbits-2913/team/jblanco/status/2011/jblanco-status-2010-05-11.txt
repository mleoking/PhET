Time period covered: May 5th through May 11th

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 3.0 hrs

•	Discussed whether this sim is ready for publication with the chemistry group, and concluded that it is.
•	Published a release candidate.
•	Fixed an issue with reset of the neutron bucket.
•	Started publication process, but ran into issues.  See "Common Code" section of this report for details.

Gene Machine II: Protein Synthesis - 3.0 hrs

•	Sent current version of slides to Sam R and Ingrid for additional input, discussed subsequent feedback with them via email.
•	Continued working on the design.

Sugar and Salt Solutions - 4.0 hrs

•	Implemented initial version of the bar chart (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Worked on the way in which concentration is calculated in the model (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Met with the Chemistry Team to discuss several questions about the simulation design, wrote up notes and sent out to group.

Common Code - 5.0 hrs 

•	Tested recent changed to ButtonNode.
•	Published a version of Neuron that demonstrates results of recent changes to ButtonNode, reviewed with original designer to make sure changes were acceptable.
•	Worked on making the bucket code common (in collaboration with Jonathan O).
•	Met with other developers (over Skype) to discuss changes to ObservableProperty.
•	Fixed an issue with ObservableProperty that could cause infinite recursion when redundantly setting a property value (in collaboration with Chris M).

Installer - 3.5 hrs

•	Researched usage rate of Win 98 and discussed with Kathy P and the developers.  It was decided that it was best to start bundling Java 6 with the installer instead of Java 5, see #2844.
•	Updated version of Java bundled with windows installer, see #2844.
•	Prototyped a version that includes activities, see #182.
•	Discussed test process for installer version with activities with Oliver N.

Build a Molecule - 1.0 hrs

•	Tested stacking behavior, found that restacking wasn't working, and talked with Jonathan O about reusing the code from Isotopes and BAA.

Customer Support - 1.0 hrs

•	Followed up on an issue concerning usage of the Linux installer on 64-bit Linux, see #2871.

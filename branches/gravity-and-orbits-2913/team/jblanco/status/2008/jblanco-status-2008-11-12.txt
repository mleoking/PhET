Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign – 10 hrs

•	Added the ability to distribute the atoms around the canvas in a reasonable way (right places, not overlapping).
•	Added the ability to switch back and forth between Polonium and the adjustable (i.e. "Custom") molecule.
•	Fixed an issue where alpha particles were being left on the screen if a reset was done just after one or more decay events occurred.
•	Started implementing the changes to the time chart to show nuclei as markers, track decay events, and distinguish between active (decaying) and non-active nuclei.
•	Continued overall design.

States of Matter Sim - 12 hrs

•	Performed some final pre-publication testing.
•	Published to the production web site.  It can be viewed here: http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/sims.php?sim=States_of_Matter.
•	Completed refactoring effort, which was this week mostly centered around pulling out and cleaning up the various algorithms for initializing and simulating the water molecules.
•	Fixed a bug where there was a visual "flash" of the cube when switching between chemicals that were in the liquid or gaseous phase.

Installer & Web Site – 10 hrs

•	Finished (at least for now) investigating IE warning issue (Unfuddle #184), concluded that there is no workable way to include MOTW, placed FAQ on web site about how to disable the warning, and marked ticket as resolved.
•	Removed MOTW code from web site (where it had been added and then commented out) and SVN.
•	Worked with Dano to get the confusing "Run Offline" button to be excluded from the installer version of the sim pages.
•	Investigated an issue with the HTML version of one of the publications.

Digital Signing (JAR files and Windows executable) - 2 hrs

•	Did some research and reading to get a basic understanding of the issue.

Meetings & Email - 6 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Normal email overhead.
•	Attended Steve P's talk.

Upcoming Work

•	Regression test the refactored version of SOM and re-deploy once completed.
•	Continue implementation of Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign.  Major next steps are implementing the adjustable half life, making the graph work, and starting on the 2nd tab.

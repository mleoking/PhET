PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco

Neuron - 17.0 hrs

•	Added the ability to have more ion channels (10 vs 5).
•	Made the capture distance for the gates bigger in order to increase the rate of membrane diffusion.
•	Experiemented with different random walk variations for the atoms in order to make diffusion a bit faster.
•	Changed the sliders that control the gates to simply say "None" and "Lots" instead of having numerical indication (this was requested at last PhET meeting).
•	Worked on an issue where icons were not being properly shown on the sliders (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Changed the locations where gates are added so that it isn't possible to have all gates on one side of the axon (also requested in last PhET meeting).
•	Added the initial version of the chart that will display the membrane potential, as well as the control to show/hide it.  It is not yet operational.
•	Studied the concept of resting potential for neurons so that we can investigate some alternative ways to simulate it.
•	Published to dev for feedback and in preparation for possible meeting with the Integrative Physiology people.

KSU Installer - 14.0 hrs

•	Met with Jonathan and Wendy to work out questions about how KSU mirrors should handle sim and installer downloads and what links should be available to the users.
•	Added the ability to sign JAR files (in collaboration with Chris M) so that distribution tags can be added.
•	Worked with Figaro support to get a working version of the jarsigner utility on Figaro.
•	Switched the target platform of the web mirror installer from Linux to Windows (this was a request from Hisham received via Wendy).
•	Tested Windows version of installer on one of the PhET machines.  Since this machine isn't configured as a server, this test is less than ideal, but will have to suffice for now.
•	Queried ITS group to see if there is a Windows IIS server that can be used to test this installer.  Unfortunately, for now there is not.
•	Removed the installation.properties marker file from the web version of the installer in order to avoid any possible mis-identification of the run mode by Java sims (recommended by Chris M).
•	Many interations of building the installers, testing them, and fixing problems.

Installer (non-KSU version) - 3.0 hrs

•	Investigated two incidents of customers reporting that they were unable to get the installer to work.  These incidents are still open (Unfuddle issues #1802 and #1820), but the best guess at this point is that their downloads were somehow corrupted.

Miscellaneous - 1.0 hrs

•	Worked with Chris to do some testing of the translation utility on Windows systems.
•	Worked with Chris to do some testing of an issue where the PBG "Test" feature doesn't work for Flash sims on some platforms. 

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

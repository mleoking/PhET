Lac Operon Sim - 18.5 hrs

•	Finished implementing the transcribing of lac I gene by RNA polymerase.
•	Implemented handling of the situation where users move the RNA polymerase or the genes while they are being transcribed.
•	Changed legend to have captions to the side, changed proportions and sizes to look good, added lactose.
•	Implemented the ability of the messenger RNA to make multiple products (either lac I or lac Z) instead of just one.
•	Delayed the appearance of the lactose injector so as not to distract from the appearance of lac I or lac Z.
•	Modified labels in the tool box to match those in the original spec in order to reduce the number of words on the panel.  We will review this with Jared and George.
•	Made probability of RNA polymerase falling off the DNA strand increase as more bumps occur.
•	Adjusted rates of production, delays, etc, to try to achieve the levels of macromolecules recommended by Jared and George.
•	Published to dev for review and feedback.
•	Reviewed with Noah P during weekly session.
•	Planning to hold a 2nd review of this sim with Jared and George of UBC on Thursday, Dec 31.

Neuron - 1.0 hrs

•	Discussed model design and user interface ideas with Noah P.

Miscellaneous - 1.5 hrs

•	Verified ticket 2019, which involves copyright dates.
•	Worked on setting up an environment to duplicate "gray rect" problem so that changes to the fix can be verified, see Unfuddle #2072.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 3.0 hrs

•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

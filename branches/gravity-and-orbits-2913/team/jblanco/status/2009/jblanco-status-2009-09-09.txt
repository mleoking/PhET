KSU Installer - 19.5

•	Got the HTTrack filters properly configured to be able to rip the entire site or a reduced subset (for quicker testing).
•	Created and tested a new BitRock project file for packaging up an Arabic-specific Linux installer.
•	Figured out how to get the BitRock installer to request the base URL during installation and substitute it into the JNLP files so that no post-processing step is necessary.
•	Worked with Jonathan to resolve some issues with the Arabic version of the web site (some still in progress).
•	Worked on how the "installers with the installer" functionality will be best implemented, have a design and implementation plan.
•	Built a reduced version of the KSU installer, tested installation on a Linux system, made available for download, passed the link on to Wendy.

Alpha & Beta Decay - 3.0 hrs

•	Fixed an issue with the linear time decay graphs being shared by Alpha and Beta decay (identified by Noah P).
•	Removed unneeded classes made obsolete by refactoring.

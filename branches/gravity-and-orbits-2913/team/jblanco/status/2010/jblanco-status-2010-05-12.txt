Lac Operon - 6.5 hrs

•	Made LacY be transcribed by RNA polymerase even if the LacZ gene isn't present (requested by Jared T).
•	Modified the meter caption (requested by Jared T).
•	Worked with Noah P and Kathy P to come up with a name.
•	Published "The Gene Machine - Lac Operon" to the production server.

Neuron Sim - 7.0 hrs

•	Tweaked gate colors to be more distinctly different to color blind people.
•	Worked on understanding how the RepaintManager works.  This was part of the optimization efforts.
•	Did a number of experiments to determine how the CPU usage could be reduced, including:
-	Reduced frame rate
-	Reduced the number of particles
-	Enabled region management debug and see if repainting large areas is causing the large CPU consumption.
•	Discussed optimization approaches with Chris M and Sam R.
•	Started work on the design of the record-and-playback feature.

Installer Builder - 4.0 hrs

•	Worked the Jonathan O to organize the effort to make the installer-builder work with the new web site.
•	Started modifying the existing installer-builder code to rip the web site from the new location.

Greenhouse - 8.0 hrs

•	Created a new module for the upcoming Photon Absorption tab, placed static picture on the tab.
•	Added new module for Greenhouse Effect that will use Piccolo instead of the old Phet custom library.
•	Added background and control panel to new module.
•	Planned out first portion of the porting effort.

Capacitor Lab - 3.0 hrs

•	Worked with Chris on issues relating to the drag handles.

Nuclear Physics - 5.0 hrs

•	Modified the wording in Radioactive Dating Game from "Guess" to "Estimate".  This was requested by Sam McKagan (see #2318).
•	Fixed an issue with Alpha Decay where the drag handles would move in the wrong direction (see #2280).
•	Investigated an issue raised by Sam McKagan about slider on bucket in 2nd tab of Radioactive Dating Game (see #2320).
•	Published new version to dev and solicited feedback.
•	Performed regression testing of all variants of Nuclear Physics.

Miscellaneous - 1.5

•	Responded to phethelp email from a guy wondering about how to launch downloaded JAR files.
•	Discussed a couple of other phethelp issues with Marj.
•	Updated the Unfuddle Notifier with the latest project schema.
•	Investigated and set up a better backup system for my laptop.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

What’s Next

•	Finish optimizing Neuron.
•	Implement concentration readout on Neuron.
•	Design and implement record-and-playback on Neuron.
•	Continue port of Greenhouse to use Piccolo.
•	Possibly implement Membrane Diffusion sim (based on input from biology folks).
•	Finish getting the installer-builder to work with the new web site.

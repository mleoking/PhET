PhET Weekly Progress Report

Greenhouse - 28.5 hrs

•	Added subscripts for all chemical symbols.
•	Restructured the control panel to contain one group of gases in alphabetical order (instead of explicitly identifying the greenhouse gases).
•	Replaced the "Earth" and "Venus" choices with a "Build Atmosphere" selection.
•	Converted the "Fire" button on the photon emitter to be a switch.  Leveraged the switch button from the Hydrogen Atom sim for this.
•	Made photon absorption probabilistic and added a developer control for adjusting it.
•	Made photon emission speed adjustable from a developer control.
•	Made Reset All remove any in-transit photons and stop any molecular oscillation.
•	Published a version for review of the set of changes above.
•	Added the infrastructure for the "Build Atmosphere" feature to the model.
•	Added an algorithm for distributing the molecules in the "atmosphere" (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Added sliders to the control panel to control the level of gases in the configurable atmosphere.
•	Made the photon emitter send out photons at various angles when the Build Atmosphere option is selected.
•	Added icons to the photon selector box.
•	Tested, fixed several issues.
•	Published a version for planned review at meeting on Tuesday, July 26.

Installer Builder - 1.5 hrs

•	Fixed an issue where the old backup directories were not being deleted once they were outdated.

Customer Support - 2.5 hrs

•	Tracked down an issue where long captions were not being properly rendered in right-to-left languages (see Unfuddle issue #2448 for details).

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 7.5 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting
•	Meeting to discuss Greenhouse sim (Kelly, Robert, Trish, Kathy, and myself).
•	Set up better filtering for email messages.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0.0 hrs

•	Upcoming vacation from July 29 (this Thursday) - August 10

What’s Next

•	Implement input from review of Photon Absorption tab in Greenhouse.
•	Support student interviews on Neuron.
•	Continue port to Piccolo of existing tabs in Greenhouse.
•	Continue work on Membrane Diffusion sim.

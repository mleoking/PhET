Greenhouse - 12.0 hrs

•	Made the slider work better for turning photon emission on and off.
•	Fixed bug where photons could go under the molecule if molecule changed during emission.
•	Fixed bug where CH4 in the configurable atmosphere was not being restored to 0 on a Reset All.
•	Changed the tab order to be Greenhouse, Glass, Photon Absorption.
•	Removed flash when photons are re-emitted in atmosphere (in collaboration with Sam).
•	Fixed an issue with the canvas transform that caused the satellite to be off the screen at startup.
•	Modified the layout of the Photon Absorption tab to fit better on 4:3 aspect ratio monitors.
•	Indented slider controls under the Build Atmosphere radio button selection on the control panel.
•	Cleaned up warnings in PhotonAbsorptionModel class.
•	Updated credits.
•	Changed units of atmosphere concentration to all be in PPM instead of a combination of PPM and PPB.
•	Updated CO2 concentration value (it has gone up since the sim was originally created (kinda scary)).

Membrane Channels - 6.0 hrs

•	Implemented different channel shapes for gated vs. non-gated channels.
•	Fixed an issue with the gated channels being open in the tool box.
•	Implemented the ability to hold the button and inject multiple particles.
•	Reviewed feedback from several people, solicited by Kathy via email.
•	Met with Noah P to discuss and disposition feedback.
•	Published a version for review.

Neuron - 6.0

•	Cleaned up all TODOs.
•	Scanned for and eliminated unused code.
•	Tested for memory leaks.
•	Tested performance, investigated some performance improvements with Sam R.
•	Investigated idea of having play-and-record cursor remain visible instead of going off the end of the chart.

Build an Atom - 3.0

•	Met with group to discuss design of this simulation.
•	Reviewed specification and made notes.

Capacitor Lab - 1.0 hr

•	Reviewed specification.

Common Code - 1.5

•	Worked with Chris M to fix a problem with graying out of LinearValueControl, worked with Sam R to verify.

Installers - 1.0 hrs

•	Resolved an issue with the Linux installer, worked with the original reporter (from Brazil) to test.

Environment - 1.5

•	Changed build-local.properties to accommodate changes to the build process.
•	Worked with Marj to do the same for her.
•	Started the process for getting SSH and SCP firewall exceptions for Figaro.  This is needed for some improvements to the build process.
•	Worked on updating the Unfuddle Notifier, ran into and issue and am pursuing.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 8.0 hrs

•	Came up with a format for a one-page report on sim status, discussed with developers and modified accordingly.
•	Weekly PhET team meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	No vacation on the immediate horizon.

What’s Next

•	Implement any changes resulting from interviews on Membrane Channels, Greenhouse, and Neuron.
•	Remove the portion of the installer-builder code that was for the version that ran with the old (pre-wicket) web site.
•	Review the spec and start the software design for the Build an Atom simulation.

Neuron Sim - 11.0 hrs

•	Implemented a rough-draft of the Hodgkins-Huxley model for membrane potential and integrated it into the existing axon model.
•	Removed all Sodium and Potassium ions from the play area.
•	Removed concentration and zoom sliders from the control panel.
•	Implemented a first cut of the chart that displays the membrane potential and hooked it up to the model.
•	Implemented a check box on the control panel that controls visibility of the voltage potential chart.
•	Added a "Stimulus Pulse" button to the control panel and hooked it up to the model.

Nuclear Physics - 3.0 hrs

•	Worked with Sam on an issue with the Piccolo library that was causing problems with layout of one of the charts.  Logged a bug with Piccolo, which has already been addressed.
•	Fixed an issue (found by Noah P) on the Decay Rates tab of Radioactive Dating Game where spurious lines could be drawn on the charts when switching between nucleus types.

Ladybug Revolution - 3.0 hrs

•	Worked with Sam to resolve 4 outstanding issues.

Lac Operon Sim - 1.0 hrs

•	Responded to Noah P's notes from his first informal interview with several possible ways to address the issues that were identified.
•	Solicited input for Jared and George prior to first round of interviews, which are scheduled for next week.
•	Planning to publish a version with some minor changes on Friday, Jan 22.  This will be the version used for initial interviews.

PhET Installers - 8.0 hrs

•	Tested the Young and Freedman installer.  Found one issue (see Unfuddle #2116), but after discussing with Wendy we decided to go ahead with delivery to Young and Freedman.
•	Posted on Spot and notified Young and Freedman that a new version is available.
•	Investigated and fixed an issue where Flash sims report "phet-installation" instead of "other-website" when launched from another web site (Unfuddle #2116).
•	Tracked down the root cause if the issue where the custom installers were taking a very long time to build (Unfuddle #2117).  Will implement a fix tomorrow and test by recreating the KSU installer.  The resulting installer will be sent to KSU as an update.

Unfuddle Issues - 1.0 hrs

•	Investigated bugs reported against Greenhouse (Unfuddle issues #2095 and #2096).  Both turned out to be Mac specific and where thus assigned back to Chris (who has since fixed them).

Development Environment - 1.0

•	Fixed an issue where the guest account password had been changed, discussed the possibility of having some sort of monitoring of this for early detection if this happens again.
•	Installed Mylyn plugin for Eclipse which allows access to Unfuddle tickets.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 4.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holidays, and Sick Time - 8.0 hrs

•	Monday Jan 18th was MLK day.

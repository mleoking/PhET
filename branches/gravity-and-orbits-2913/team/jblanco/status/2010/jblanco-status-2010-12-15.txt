Build an Atom - 11.0 hrs

•	Met with the Chemistry Team to review recent changes, review release candidate.
•	Met with Kelly to prioritize and disposition comments that resulted from review of release candidate.
•	Fixed: Reset All didn't reset the check boxes on 1st tab.
•	Fixed: Spinner in counts-to-charge-question was not colorizing the text.
•	Added additional isotopes to all levels.
•	Ran through color blindness checker and circulated results.
•	Made all non-schematic probs at all levels be heavier than lithium.
•	Made the text area for the spinners on the game select text on focus - this makes it easier for users to enter their answers (done in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Fixed an issue where it was possible to get two of the same problem type in a row on some levels.
•	Posted release candidates to dev.

Molecules and Light - 10.0 hrs

•	Tested for color blindness and circulated the results.
•	Drew up a sketch of a single shot button, reviewed at chem meeting.
•	Reviewed current version with Chemistry Team.
•	Flipped the controls on the control panel that selects photon wavelength.
•	Increased the text size for the wavelength selector buttons.
•	Made oxygen a bit orange to increase visibility for color blind people.
•	Added the "Return Atom" button.
•	Internal code cleanup.

Common Code - 1.0

•	Changed a number of the game strings to make them clearer and less "in your face".

Isotope - 2.0 hrs

•	Modified drawing to show chemical symbols in the pie chart off to the side of the percentage indicators.
•	Met with Chemistry Group to review the latest set of drawings.
•	Added latest drawing for the 2nd tab to the specification.

Gravity and Orbits (in collaboration with Sam R) - 2.0 hrs

•	Made the planet and moon look different from Earth and Earth's moon when the masses are different.
•	Modified masses in Earth-Satellite system to be expressed in terms of satellite masses.
•	Fixed some issues with mass representations.

Interviews - 2.5 hrs

•	Attended presentation by and then interviewed a candidate for a post-doc position.
•	Wrote up thoughts on candidate.

Customer Support - 1.0 hrs

•	Finalized the FAQs and worked with Jonathan to get them published to the web site.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Will be taking some time over the holidays, as yet TBD.

What’s Next

•	Get Build an Atom published to production server.
•	Finish current round of development on Molecules & Light.
•	Determine whether we want a wave representation on molecules and light.
•	Set up the Isotope simulation and start code development.
•	Implement any changes resulting from interviews on Membrane Channels (if conducted).

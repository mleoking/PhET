<h1>PhET Source Code Management</h1>
<h2>Source code repository</h2>
<p>
PhET uses SVN (aka, Subversion) for source code control, and the SVN repository is 
hosted by SourceForge. Anyone can read from the repository. But to commit changes,
you'll need a SourceForge login. Ask one of the PhET developers to set you up.
</p>
<p>
PhET's project page on SourceForge is:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phet/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/phet/</a>
<p>
For configuring SVN clients, the SVN repository URL is: 
https://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/phet
</p>
<h2>SVN Clients</h2>
<p>
If you're using Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, read on.
If you're using something else, you're on your own and can skip this section.
</p>
<p>
IntelliJ IDEA has integrated SVN support. Consult the IDEA user guide for details.
</p>
<p>
As of version 3.3, Eclipse does not have built-in SVN support. You'll need to install
an SVN client plug-in. Your options are Subversive and Subclipse.  
We recommend that you use Subversive.
</p>
<p>
<i>Subversive</i> was formerly a third-party plug-in, but has recently become an official part of the Eclipse project.
It is currently in the incubation phase of integration with Eclipse, but will eventually be bundled with Eclipse.
Its interface is similar to Eclipse CVS, and it has good performance.  
Subversive requires Eclipse 3.3 or higher. 
Get Subversive at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/">http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/</a>. 
Beware that the installation instructions are in many cases incorrect.  
If you encounter problems, ask one of the PhET developers for help.
</p>
<p>
<i>Subclipse</i> is your other option. 
It is available at <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">http://subclipse.tigris.org/</a>.
If you're familiar with Eclipse CVS, you'll find Subclipse to be maddening; it doesn't work the same way. 
The biggest downside of Subclipse is performance; it can take minutes to synchronize your working copy 
with the repository.  And since Subversive is on track to becoming an integrated part of Eclipse, 
there is really no reason to use Subclipse.
</p>
<h2>Repository Organization</h2>
<p>
The repository organization is documented in these README files:
<ul>
<li><i>trunk/README.txt</i> : top-level directories</li>
<li><i>trunk/simulations-java/README.txt</i> : all Java simulations</li>
<li><i>trunk/simulations-java/simulations/README.txt</i> : individual Java simulations</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
TERMINOLOGY ALERT! Each directory under <i>trunk/simulations-java/simulations</i> is referred to as a <i>project</i>, 
and contains the code for one or more simulations. Each simulation built from a project 
is referred to as a <i>flavor</i>.  Some projects may have only 1 flavor, or may have 
a flavor name that is identical to the project name.
</p>
<h2>Checking out source code for Java simulations</h2>
<p>
All PhET source code is under trunk; we never create branches or tags.
</p>
<p>
All Java simulations live under <i>trunk/simulations-java</i>.
</p>
<p>
If you're using Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, read on.
If you're using something else, you're on your own and can skip the remainder of this section.
</p>
<p>
If you're using Eclipse, check out <i>trunk/simulations-java</i> as a Java project 
named <i>simulations-java</i>. Then follow the instructions in <i>simulations-java/ide/eclipse/README.txt</i>.
</p>
<p>
If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, look in <i>simulations-java/ide/intellij</i> for similar instructions, 
or contact Sam Reid.
</p>
<p>
Test your working copy by running class <i>FaradayApplication</i> as a Java application.
If you experience build errors, then your classpath is set incorrectly.
Re-read the above instructions, then ask a PhET developer for help.
</p>
<h2>Building and deploying simulations</h2>
<p>
Ant is used to build and deploy simulations.
See <i>simulations-java/build.xml</i> and <i>build-ancillary.xml</i> for details.
The most common targets are documented at the top of <i>build.xml</i>.
</p>
If you are not a member of the PhET development team, it is unlikely that you will
be able to use any of the build targets with <i>deploy</i> in their name.  
These targets deploy simulations to the PhET productions and 
development servers; they require logins for the PhET servers, as well as commit
permissions for the SVN repository. 
<p>
WARNING: Until you are very familiar with how simulations are built and deployed,
please use only the <i>launch-sims</i> (default) target.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Because the buildfiles make heavy use of Antform, you may not be able to run
builds from inside Eclipse.  This is due to a general problem with AWT threads.
If you experience this problem, use the <i>build.sh</i> (Mac, Linux) or <i>build.bat</i> (Windows)
scripts to run builds.

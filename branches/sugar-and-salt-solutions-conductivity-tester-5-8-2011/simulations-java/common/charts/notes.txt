Design decisions:

Chart.java is 480 lines with 5 inner classes, 205 lines without these classes.

Here are these inner classes:
*GridLineSet
*Axis
Grid
AbstractGrid
AxisGrid

The client should know about those marked with a *.

So I will move those to upper level, as public classes, and the others to upper level as package-protected classes.
We can change this at any time.

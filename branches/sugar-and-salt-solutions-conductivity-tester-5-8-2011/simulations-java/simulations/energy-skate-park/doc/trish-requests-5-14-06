Here are some comments from Trish regarding the Energy Skater simulation.
Regarding the first one, you can drag the skater into the ground,
which she thought was unexpected, not useful, and came across as a bug.
You can also drag him off the screen, and if you then let go of the mouse, you're sunk.
She thought it would be most useful if the potential energy 0 point was at ground level by default,
and then possibly have the option to change it.
Finally, the name on the title bar doesn't match the name on the web site.

Hi Ron, This is a note to remind you to look at Skater.
1.The skater can "go into the ground".
2.His PE is not zero at the ground
 3. He can be dragged below the window.
4.The name on the control panel is a little undiscriptive.

Sam,
   This is looking really really nice!  I have  a couple of minor comments

1.  I think the grayscale and particles options should be one on top of the
other rather than side by side.  This way the two radio buttons will be
lined upon the left.
2.  I would like to see the red x for closing a detector actually on the
detector itself in the empty area in the bottom left corner.

The performance on the particle view looks great.

As for your questions, some of these are Noah's area like the units. Movable
faucets are really cool but before you make them move side to side in two
drip mode, let's interview.  Sounds like it'd be a lot of work.

Movable sources for sound and light don't seem as important as they are for
water.  If it can be done with a minimal amount of work then I'd suggest
doing the same things that you've done with the faucets.

I don't think the crosshairs need moved now that they are attached with a
cord.

I think I'd put the red x for hide screen a little higher on the screen,
unfortunately it can't be right in the corner because of the 3-D look. If it
could be made a little smaller it might look better also.
I'd also move the button for the intensity graph to the middle, right where
the show screen button lines up when the screen is closed.  That will
separate the x from the button. Now they look like they function together.

Is it possible to limit the amount a window can be reduced?  Will this solve
the problem with things getting ugly when it's minimized too far?
I just tried it at 1024 x 768.  The worst part is the Wavelength and
Amplitude Controls.  Can this be reduced some so that it doesn't dominate
the screen at this resolution.  I think at other resolutions it will not
hurt to shrink it some.
What does switching rederers mean?

I think I would leave the faucets the way they are when you switch to side
view.  Not worth the trouble.

Noah, let me know if I'm not thinking of things here.

Kelly Lancaster's model for the Titration simulation, written in Octave.

Notes about the Octave code:

Ca (and Cb) is the concentration of acid (and base); the range is 0.001 to 1 M.

Va (and Vb) is the volume of acid (and base); when base is the titrant, 
Va is 25 mL and Vb goes from 0 to 75 mL in 0.1 mL increments.  
When acid is the titrant, Vb is 25 mL and Va goes from 0 to 75 mL.  
The only exception is for a triprotic acid, where Vb must go from 0 to 100 mL to see the full curve.

Ka (and Kb) are dissociation constants; the range over which you can 
see a change in the titration curve is 1e0 to 1e-14.  K1, K2 and K3 
are the same constants for diprotic and triprotic acids; they should
really be called Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3.  They have the same range as Ka, 
but K2 must be less than K1, and K3 must be less than K2.

Some Octave tests:

strongbase( 0.1, 0.1, 0:0.1:75, 25 )
weakbase( 0.1, 0.1, 0:0.1:75, 25, 0.1 )
strongacid( 0.1, 0.1, 25, 0:0.1:75 )
weakacid( 0.1, 0.1, 25, 0:0.1:75, 1e-5 )
diproticacid( 0.1, 0.1, 25, 0:0.1:75, 1e-5, 1e-6 )
triproticacid( 0.1, 0.1, 25, 0:0.1:100, 1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-7 )

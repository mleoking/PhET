OK, I hadn't realized that you were already running it at
NUM_RICHARDSON_STEPS_PER_UPDATE = 1, and that changing this would cause
such a performance impact.  It makes sense.  There's still a factor of
10 discrepancy that I can't figure out, but I'm just going to roll it
into my new suggested units and not worry about it:

		        dt	Richardson calls	Units per clock tick
Electrons	0.05	1 			0.5 fs
Neutrons	0.1	1 			1 ps
He Atoms	0.5	1 			5 ps

For medium resolution, the clock should only tick every fourth step, or
it should tick in increments that are 4x smaller.  For high resolution,
the clock should only tick every sixteenth step, or it should tick in
increments that are 16x smaller.

		echo/print mix removed, large parameter lists changed to associative arrays for
		easier handling and changes, recode of insert statement generation from classes
		to associative arrays, phet_production-like enum values for sim-type, conditional
		insertion for normalized tables to prevent duplicates, improved error handling,
		code reformatting and cleanup (embedded strings, HEREDOC for long queries),

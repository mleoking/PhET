January 7, 2009

Note: This report covers the period from December 30 2008 through January 7, 2009 (9 calendar days) due to changes in the regular meeting schedule.

States of Matter Sim - 10.5 hrs

•	Revised epsilon value for Neon to be lower (based on input from Paul Beale).
•	Narrowed range of adjustable attraction to it wouldn't overlap with neon and would go no greater than water.
•	Revised the Phase and Interaction Potential diagrams on the Phase Changes tab to look more consistent.
•	Made buttons for hiding/showing diagrams the same size.
•	Made the line that shows the lower minimum of the potential curve grabbable and adjustable (request from Wendy).
•	Implemented a number of minor interface changes requested by Wendy A. and Noah P.
•	Published updated version and requested feedback.

Nuclear Fission Sim - 15.0 hrs

•	Moved the Reset button to be near the ray gun and made it only appear when the nucleus could actually be reset.
•	Incorporated new version of "Fire" button and some anti-aliasing code to make it look better.
•	Disabled rotation of the gun on the first tab, since it tended to be unresponsive and is irrelevant anyway.
•	Made energy graphs on the Reactor tab always visible and removed the UI control to hide them.
•	Made the button for firing neutrons into the reactor match the one now used by the gun, and attached the control to the reactor.
•	Made a Reset Nuclei button for the reactor and made it only appear when some nuclei had decayed.
•	Implemented a delay before reset button appears after nucleus has decayed.
•	Improved behavior of the Fire button based on input from Wendy A. and Noah P.
•	Incorporated a new image of a mushroom cloud that is compatible with our licensing policy.

Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign - 15.0 hrs

•	Implemented the ability to return nuclei to bucket, including animation.
•	Implemented several minor interface changes based on input from Noah P.
•	Changed the energy-lines-to-half-life relationship to make the Polonium display more user-friendly.
•	Changed the stacking height on the time chart in order to make the exponential curve shape more apparent.
•	Made string used in time line and on time display into resources (in support of translation).
•	Implemented several minor interface changes based on input from Noah P.
•	Fixed a number of bugs found during unit testing.
•	Reviewed behavior with Noah P. and Kathy P.

Installer & Web Site – 0.5 hrs

•	Tested the latest installer to make sure it is working correctly.

PhET Server - 1.0

•	Worked with the IT department to find out how to set up the server for access outside of the university's firewall.
•	Obtained a static IP address.

Miscellaneous - 0.5 hrs

•	Updated and closed a set of Unfuddle tickets that were created for States of Matter when it was first started (before I was here).

Meetings & Email - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Holidays - 8.0 hrs

•	January 1 taken as a holiday.

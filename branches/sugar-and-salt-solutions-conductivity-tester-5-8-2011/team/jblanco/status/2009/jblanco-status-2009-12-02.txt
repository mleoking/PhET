PhET Weekly Progress Report

December 2, 2009

Note: Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, this report covers a two-week period, from November 19th through December 2nd.

Lac Operon Sim - 23.0 hrs

•	Made LacI gene produce a process arrow instead of directly creating LacI.
•	Generalized the fade in/out behavior to be usable by all simple model elements.
•	Implemented interaction between fading in/out and attaching to other elements.
•	Published a version that starts with genes and operators in place and several elements moving around.  This was done as a snapshot before major changes to the interface.
•	Implemented initial version of the "DNA Segment Tool Box".  This currently shows the model elements that can be placed into the DNA and allows the user to select them.
•	Changed the DNA representation to have spaces and outlines where the genes and other segments should be placed.
•	Briefly discussed some behavioral elements with Noah P and Wendy.

Custom Installers - 11.0 hrs

•	Fixed an issue where version information was not being properly incorporated into the installer.
•	Built the Young and Freedman installer and posted it to Spot.  The customer has downloaded it and reported that they have successful extracted the files.
•	Rebuilt KSU installer twice, due to a need to incorporate the latest Arabic-translated sims.  Let Hisham know that it is available, currently awaiting feedback from him and his group.
•	Spent some time trying to determine why the rip of the web site takes so long (KSU installer takes ~4 hours, the Y&F installer takes ~12 hours).  Best theory at this point is that the ripper utility is taking a long time to try to parse the JNLP files for links.  Will log a support issue with the makers of HTTrack if this is still a problem once the Wicket site is hosted on Figaro.
•	Retargeted the installer builders to rip from phet-server instead of Figaro so that Jonathan can safely work with ITS to get Figaro correctly configured.
•	Cleanup: Removed some installer-builder code that is now unused or redundant.

Radioactive Dating Game Sim - 7.0

•	Reviewed and discussed feedback from users at the school where Sam R's wife works, who are planning to use it in a class on December 7th.  The note below reflect the actions taken.
•	Incorporated new version of probe created by Noah P.
•	Modified labels on decay proportions graph to be clearer and more consistent.
•	Published a version for review, got feedback, made more mods, and published another.
•	Verified a fix made by Sam R that allows the 2nd tab to work with Piccolo 1.3.

User Support - 0.5 hrs

•	Worked with Marj to support a customer who is having issues with installing on Ubuntu.

Miscellaneous - 1.5 hrs

•	Worked with Sam R. on a Utility to verify signature time stamp on JAR files.
•	Supported Mike D on getting Collision Lab deployed to Spot.
•	Installed CoreUtils on my Windows machine, which gives me Linux-like command line operations, and should increase productivity.
•	Did some reading and experimenting with Flash.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Holiday and Vacation - 32 hrs

•	2 days vacation time.
•	2 days of holiday time (Thanksgiving and the day after).

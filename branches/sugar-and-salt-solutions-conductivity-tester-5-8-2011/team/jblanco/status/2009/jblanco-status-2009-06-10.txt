Note: This report covers a two-week period from May 28 through June 10 2009, during which I took a week of vacation.

Radiometric Dating Game – 24.0 hrs

•	Added the "edge of the earth" effect to the dating game tab in order to create a better visual cue to users that the datable items are under the ground.
•	Added the movable indicator to the graph that allows users to determine the percentage of parent nuclei remaining at a given time.
•	Fixed an issue with the cable not being attached to the meter when the probe wasn't touching a datable item.
•	Added the capability to the decay chart to only show the curve for the parent element, and not always both parent and daughter.
•	Fixed issues with how the pie chart on the nucleus proportions chart was being sized.
•	Fixed some memory leak issues, and did other refactorings and cleanup of the code for greater extensibility and maintainability.
•	Reviewed the specification for the new tab with Noah P.

Alpha Decay - 5.0

•	Fixed an issue where Lead-207 was being labeled in some instances as 206.  This was identified by one of the translators.
•	Added code to scale labels better when a translator used a single character as the chemical symbol for a nucleus.
•	Regression testing, published to Dev for review, then republished to the production website.

Atomic Interactions - 2.5

•	Met with Noah P, Trish, Wendy, Kathy, and Jack to discuss changes needed in order to address suggestions from by Tom Pentecost et al.
•	Worked with Chris M on possible ways to make the edges of the particles look less definite.

Energy Skate Park - 1.0

•	Fixed an issue where strings that had recently been made translatable were not appearing in the translation utility.

Installer & Web Site – 2.5 hrs

•	Tracked down an issue where the automated weekly rebuild failed.  Turned out to be due to PhET exceeding our disk quota on Tigercat.
•	Reduced the number of backups maintained of the installers to two in order to decrease disk space usage.
•	Rebuilt and tested the installers (since the automated build failed).
•	Investigated some reports of slowness on the web site reported by Wendy.
•	Added the information about upcoming workshops and the associated flyer to the web site (requested by Trish).

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5 hrs

•	Two weekly PhET meetings (Thu May 28 and Wed June 10).
•	Maintaining and updating unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation and Holidays - 40.0 hrs

•	Vacation

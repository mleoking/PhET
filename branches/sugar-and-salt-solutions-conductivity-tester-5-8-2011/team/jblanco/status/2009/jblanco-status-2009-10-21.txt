Lac Operon - 18.0 hrs

•	Studied specification, researched the basic concepts, worked on the design.
•	Set up initial project based on the sim-templete, put it all in SVN.
•	Created initial versions of model, canvas, and base classes needed for the model.
•	Added model elements for LacZ, glucose, and galactose.
•	Worked on creating the "binding area" on the LacZ molecule (in collaboration with Sam).

Neuron - 8.0 hrs

•	Met with Janet from Integrated Physiology to review the state of the Neuron sim and get feedback and ideas for moving forward.
•	Prototyped zoom in/out capability, since this came up as a possibility during the review meeting.
•	Discussed changes and new design with Noah.

KSU Installer - 7.0 hrs

•	Tested KSU's installation of the "lite" installer, found an issue with their server configuration, notified them and let them know how to fix it.
•	Fixed an issue where the local installers were including the individually translated jar files, which was inflating the sizes of all installers by roughly 2x.
•	Figured out how to run installer builder as a separate job (necessary because the shell times out on a full build).
•	Investigated an issue where two sims had dead links, worked with Jonathan to resolve.
•	Tested several iterations of lite and full installers, fixed issues found.
•	Built a full installer, including time-stamped jar files, and archived it on Spot in case it is needed prior to the translation being completed.

•	Investigated an issue where the bucket slider looks wrong on the Mac platform.

Support - 0.5 hrs

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

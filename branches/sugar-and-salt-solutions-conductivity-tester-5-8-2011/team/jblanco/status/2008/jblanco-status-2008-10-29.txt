Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign – 16 hrs

•	Created infrastructure for two tabs (multiple nuclei and single nucleus).
•	Provided more input to Noah P on the specification, and Noah has generated a new version.
•	Implemented the control panel that allows the user to choose between polonium or custom nuclei.
•	Modified the control panel legend to show only protons, neutrons, and alpha particles.
•	Implemented the "Bucket of Nuclei", which is a user interface device for adding nuclei to the canvas.

States of Matter Sim - 12 hrs

•	Continued work on refactoring and cleanup to improve extensibility and maintainability.  Nearing completion.
•	Improved the initial size and behavior of the "crystal" that is formed when phase state is set to solid (refactored version only).
•	Fixed some issues in the StoveNode that Chris M. saw while reviewing the code.
•	Published most recent version (which uses the non-refactored model) and requested input on behavior to determine if it is ready to publish to the production server.

Installer & Web Site – 8 hrs

•	Worked with Dano to implement an test MOTW fix for Unfuddle #184.  Unfortunately, we hit a major snag on this in that it seems to work fine for flash sims but not Java sims.
•	Located an appropriate forum and posted questions about MOTW and JNLP.  Got some responses, but no solutions yet.
•	Added redirects for some old links that Wendy had seen on the Team Page.
•	Created a script for quicker testing of the installer, which works by ripping only a small portion of the web site.

Miscellaneous  - 1 hr

•	Tested out the dual boot Mac that the JILA IT folks set up for us.  Seems to work well.
•	Worked with Marj on updating XML schema on Unfuddle email server.


Meetings & Email - 3 hrs

•	Normal email overhead.

Upcoming Work

•	Finish refactoring of SOM multi-particle model and perform thorough regression test.
•	Get SOM reviewed and implement and publication-blocking issues.
•	Continue implementation of Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign.
•	Look for resolution to MOTW and JNLP issue (Unfuddle #184).
•	Work with Dano to resolve some other issues surrounding the launching of locally installed sims.

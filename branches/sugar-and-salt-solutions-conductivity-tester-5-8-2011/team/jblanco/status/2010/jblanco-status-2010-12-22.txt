PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
December 22, 2010

Molecules and Light - 16.5 hrs

•	Finalized the break-apart algorithms for O3 and NO2.
•	Fixed bug with multiple bonds depicted in the vertical direction.
•	Created and integrated a new image for the UV emitter.
•	Enhanced the rotation and vibration algorithms to work together, meaning that molecules will vibrate correctly after being rotated.
•	Fixed issue where Reset All doesn't reset rotation.
•	Checked the behavior of all photon-molecule combinations against the spec.
•	Consolidated code between Photon Absorption tab in Greenhouse and the Molecules and Light sim to minimize redundancy.
•	Internationalized all strings.
•	Internal code cleanup.
•	Published to dev for review and as a candidate version for interviews.

Build an Atom - 3.5 hrs

•	Changed an indicator title from "Charge" to "Net Charge" based on feedback from Suzanne B.
•	Discussed via email with Kelly getting final approval for release to production.
•	Added Suzanne B to the credits.
•	Published version 2.0, which is the first public version to include the game, to the production web site.

Greenhouse - 1.5 hrs

•	Regression tested Photon Absorption tab to make sure it still works after changes to code shared with Molecules and Light sim.
•	Posted version to dev for review by Kathy P - she needs to check reflection behavior of clouds.

Nuclear Physics - 1.0 hrs

•	Changed several image file names to remove spaces.  This came up during review of licensing issues.

Isotope - 0.5 hrs

•	Fixed issue the drawing of first tab where Sulphur was selected and entire periodic table appeared to be selectable.

Licensing - 3.0 hrs

•	Resolved all issues with Greenhouse and Nuclear Physics except sound effects.
•	Investigated the licensing of the sound effects contained on Mike D's sound effects CD.

Oregon Virtual School District - 3.0 hrs

•	Setting up, preparing for, and participating in initial meeting to discuss technical aspects of planned collaboration.  Note from meeting available upon request.
•	Started investigating whether the distribution tag could be used to identify when sims are run from the OVSD web site.
•	Wrote up and circulated notes from meeting.

Installers - 0.5 hrs

•	Downloaded and tested, since Carl W reported having had some issues.

Customer Support - 1.5 hrs

•	Verified fix of bug in Greenhouse that affected Japanese translation, posted to dev for review by Kathy, see #2598.
•	Responded to a customer who wants to set up a local mirror so that they can reduce external bandwidth, see #2619.
•	Discussed with Kathy P some approaches to supporting customers who want to do local hosting.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 9.0 hrs

•	Two weekly PhET team meetings (12/16 & 12/22).
•	Discussion with Sam on general software engineering, good use of Java, how Scala knowledge affects use of Java.
•	Discussion with Chris on the qualities of good code.
•	Sent out links to press release to several individuals outside the university who expressed interest.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Will be taking some time over the holidays, as yet TBD.

What’s Next

•	Set up the Isotope simulation and start code development.

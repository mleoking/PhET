PhET Weekly Progress Report

Lac Operon Sim - 20.0 hrs

•	Finished adding ability to inject a constant stream of lactose.
•	Updated labels based on Jared's input.
•	Made the mRna transcribe right above the gene (this was requested at last PhET meeting).
•	Made the RNA polymerase drift angularly away from DNA so it doesn't interfere visually with mRNA.
•	Made detach after bounce look better.
•	Fixed bug - the LacI is not bonding to lactose when on the lac operator.
•	Implemented code to allow LacI to re-attach to lactose after ejecting lactose.
•	Flipped the injector over to the left side and the legend to the right.
•	Tweaked params to obtain (roughly) the desired numbers of LacI and LacZ.
•	Modify lactose so that it goes for a while before being grabbed so that inject doesn't look odd.
•	Add a delay for lactose reattaching to LacI so that it can get digest by LacZ if present.
•	Made the dotted lines go away when component added to DNA strand.
•	Fixed an issue (with help from Sam R and Chris M) where the invisible legend was interfering with ability to interact with other nodes in the play area.
•	Changed the font used for all labels (with help from Chris M) so that it will be easier for users to recognize labels like "lacI" and not mistake it for "lacl".
•	Reviewed with Noah P.
•	Internal code cleanup: Changed the motion strategies so that they don't require a reference to the element that they are moving.
•	Profiled and tested for memory leaks, found none.
•	Tested on a relatively slow PC, seemed to run fine.
•	Published a new version to the dev server, you can see it here: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/gene-network/0.0.07/

Neuron Sim - 4.5 hrs

•	Reviewed spec, made markup notes, went over it with Noah P.
•	Studied Hodgkins-Huxley model and started implementing it.

Nuclear Physics - 3.0 hrs

•	Fixed an issue that was reported by a user where the layout of the decay chart on the first tab could get messed up.
•	Removed all unused images in order to reduce the size of the executable file.
•	Published a new version to dev for review, you can see it here: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/nuclear-physics/3.20.03/

Unfuddle Issues - 3.0 hrs

•	Started investigation of an issue with CCK virtual labs (Unfuddle #2103).
•	Emailed the people in India for more information about the issue they are experiencing with Firefox (Unfuddle #2079)

Development Environment - 3.0

•	Tracked down an issue with the Unfuddle notifier, fixed the problem, and made changes to decrease the likelihood of recurrence (see Unfuddle #232).

PhET Installers - 1.5 hrs

•	Tested the latest weekly build on Linux.  Marj tested it on PC and Mac in preparation for making a new CD for mail distribution.
•	Retargeted the custom installer builder to phetsims.colorado.edu.
•	Kicked off a rebuild of the Young and Freedman custom installer (and it is still working on it 25.5 hours later).

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

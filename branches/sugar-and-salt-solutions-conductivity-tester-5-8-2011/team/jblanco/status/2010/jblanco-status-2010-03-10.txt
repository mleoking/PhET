PhET Weekly Progress Report

Neuron Sim - 16.0 hrs

•	Implemented an alternative version of the membrane potential model using equations created by Noah P.
•	Modified the membrane potential chart to clear and start over when it fills up.  This uses far less CPU power than the scrolling chart, and solves the issue where the scrolling chart dragged down the sim.
•	Corrected an error with the directions of currents shown on the developer controls.
•	Implemented a better algorithm for distributing the channels on the membrane.
•	Set up the channel distribution such that when fully zoomed in, one of each type of gate is visible.
•	Made the "Stimulate Neuron" button be invisible when the neuron can't be stimulated.
•	Widened the spatial range of the non-moving particles so that it looks reasonable when fully zoomed out.
•	Added a custom zoom control in the play area.
•	Met with Noah P and reviewed current status.
•	Started investigating the addition of play and record.
•	Next step is to start on the implementation of the other tabs.

Lac Operon - 14.0 hrs

•	Added initial version of the lactose meter, got feedback, made modifications, and published again.
•	Added an "Off Chart" indication to the lactose meter.
•	Added ability to move LacZ and LacI near lactose and have them bond.
•	Investigated an issue with lingering LacI molecules.  Was unable to duplicate, but made some changes that may resolve the issue.
•	Make disabled LacI move away from the DNA strand, which looks less cluttered.
•	Profiled and checked for memory leaks.
•	The current version is probably ready to share with Jared and George.

Circuit Construction Kit - 2.0 hrs

•	Worked with Sam on a possible solution for the issue with low-resistance circuits.  Didn’t solve the problem.
 
Miscellaneous Issues - 3.0

•	Responded to a user who was having problems running downloaded sims, see issue #2187 for details.
•	Worked with Chris M on an issue with PSwing in Piccolo 1.3 rc4.
•	Worked with Marj on an issue where downloaded Flash sims were not running.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Sick Leave, and Holidays

•	Planning to take vacation on the week of March 22nd.

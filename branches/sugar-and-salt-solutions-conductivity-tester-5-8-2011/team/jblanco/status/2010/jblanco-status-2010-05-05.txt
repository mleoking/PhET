Lac Operon - 19.0 hrs

•	Solicited feedback from George and Jared of UBC, discussed their responses with them.
•	Implemented UBC requests, including:
-	LacI should not affect production of LacZ-LacY when lac operator not present.
-	Few LacYs should be produced than LacZs for each mRNA strand
-	Less LacI should be produced.
-	Made lactose inject further into the cell.
-	Tried to duplicate another issue they mentioned, but was unable to do so.
-	Made LacI bind to lac operator more quickly.
-	Made LacI hold on to lactose longer.
-	Having discussion about one final issue: Having a LacY in the membrane at startup.
•	Fixed bug involving the auto/manual buttons.
•	Fixed bug with how the sim operates when speed slider is maxed out.
•	Reviewed all changes with Noah P.
•	Cleaned up dead code and TODO markers.
•	Published revised version to dev.
•	Sent out a response to Jared and George describing all responses to feedback, awaiting response.


Neuron Sim - 11.75 hrs

•	Added additional particles.
•	Cleaned up dead and commented out code.
•	Sketched up showing of charges, reviewed with Noah.
•	Started implementation of showing charges.
•	Met with Noah and Kathy to discuss future of Membrane Diffusion tab.
•	Several minor UI mods to make particles and gates look better.
•	Tested on Mac and slow PC to see if optimization is required.
•	Lots of testing.
•	Removed Membrane Diffusion tab.
•	Ran color blindness analysis, have decided that it is okay.

Greenhouse - 5.0 hrs

•	Met with Kathy P, Kelly L, and Robert P to discuss the addition of a tab for showing single photon absorption.
•	Studied code, put together estimate of time to move to Piccolo.
•	Met with Kelly L's first cut at new tab with her and Noah P.

Miscellaneous - 0.25

•	Publish Lac Operon to the production web site.
•	Finish last features for Neuron.
•	Optimize Neuron.
•	Get Neuron signed off on by the IPhy folks
•	Set up separate Membrane Diffusion sim, start work on it.
•	Work on converting Greenhouse to use Piccolo

•	Met with Kelly to list and prioritize changes based on recent interviews and feedback from meetings.
•	Changed captions in the photon emission control to include the word "Photon".
•	Moved the slider from the control panel to the photon emitter image (i.e. the flashlight and the heat lamp).

Balancing Equations - 2.0 hrs

•	Reviewed specification.
•	Looked at apps that are currently available on line.

Membrane Channels - 0.5 hrs

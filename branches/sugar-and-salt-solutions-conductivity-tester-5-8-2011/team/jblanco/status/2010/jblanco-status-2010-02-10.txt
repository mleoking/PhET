Neuron Sim - 26.5 hrs

•	Worked on specification - added comments to try to clarify audience and goals, drew up diagrams for tabs conveying the idea of propagation and of membrane permeability.
•	Implemented feature where action potential appears to move down the membrane before arriving at the cross section.
•	Created gated channels that open and close based on the amount of current in the corresponding channel in the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
•	Got the potential chart to always stay centered.
•	Got the canvas to shift and resize then the potential graph is shown so that the neuron cross section remains visible (in collaboration with Sam).
•	Discussed software design of Neuron sim with Sam R.
•	Discussed functional design of Neuron sim as well as possible issues with Noah P.
•	Worked with Chris on changing over to use the thread save EventListenerList instead of ArrayList for regsitering listeners.
•	Researched action potentials and wrote up and clarified questions for the I-Phy people.  Planning to meet with them next Tuesday, Feb 16.

Reactants, Products, and Leftovers - 1.0 hrs

•	Worked with Chris M to reproduce and isolate a bug in the game behavior (Unfuddle #2156).

Moving Man - 0.5 hrs

•	Worked with Sam to fix an issue in Moving Man where acceleration and/or velocity could revert to 0 (Unfuddle #2150).

Lac Operon Sim - 0.25 hrs

•	Investigated an issue where a small blue circle appears in play area when run on the Mac.

Common Code - 0.25 hrs

•	Moved ReversePathIterator from the Nuclear Physics project to phetcommon so it could be used in the Neuron sim.

Unfuddle Issues - 1.5 hrs

•	Followed up on the issue with CCK Virtual Labs (Unfuddle #2103).
•	Verified two tickets fixed by Chris M that involved Greenhouse (#2095 and #2065).

Piccolo 1.3 - 3.0

•	Downloaded the latest release candidate (piccolo-1.3-rc2) and put into the repository.
•	Tested, found an issue (logged as Unfuddle #2157), worked primarily with Chris M but also with Sam to determine severity and our course of action.  We ultimately decided to vote to fail the release and to work with the Piccolo team to resolve the issue.
•	Retested on a version of rc2 where the root of the issue had been fixed.

Development Environment - 1.0

•	Tried some things to correct issues occuring with Eclipse SVN plugin, also discussed with Chris.

PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
April 6th, 2011

Time period covered: March 31st through April 6th.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 16.5 hrs

•	Changed buttons on periodic table to be more general and work on Mac, Windows Classic.
•	Improved performance when switching to Nature's mix.
•	Fixed issue with background of radio buttons on Mac.
•	Improved button colors for More/Less button.
•	Scaled text on average atomic mass readout so that it will work on Mac.
•	Fixed bug where exception occurred if the user extracts all neutrons from Neon then attempts to put them back.
•	Fixed bug where no readout was being shown on the Average Atomic Mass indicator when a single atom was in the chamber.
•	Reviewed with Kelly (2x),listed and prioritized needed changes.
•	Expanded size of number box associated with the sliders.
•	Limited pie chart labels to 1 decimal place when showing User's Mix 
•	Made font in pie chart match that of average atomic mass indicator to make it easier for user to connect the two.
•	Fixed some issues with label positions on the pie chart.
•	Switched to "bulk add" when resoring state to improve performance.
•	Fixed but with update of Average Atomic Mass readout when switching to Nature's Mix.
•	Cleaned up code structure and comments.
•	Discussed and started investigating and issue with significant figures.
•	Published versions to dev for interviews.

Gene Machine II: Protein Synthesis - 3.5 hrs

•	Met with Kathy P to review and revise first tab.
•	Circulated notes and updated drawing based on meeting.
•	Researched concepts and terms.

Build a Molecule - 2.5 hrs

•	Met with Emily M, Kelly L, and Jonathan O to discuss design.

Build an Atom - 1.5 hrs

•	Performed some regression testing.
•	Fixed an issue where extraction of atoms from the 2nd shell when in cloud view does not work properly.

Nuclear Physics - 1.5 hrs

•	Redeployed production version to solve problem with RTL languages.

Common Code - 1.0 hrs

•	Tested fix for bug with speed control slider (see #2789), reported issue on Windows, retested, discussed change to caption.

Interviews - 2.5 hrs

•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0.0 hrs

•	Nothing on the immediate horizon.

What’s Next

•	Continue with final steps of implementing Isotopes sim.
•	Code review of Density/Buoyancy simulation.
•	Continue refining design of Build a Molecule simulation.
•	Continue implementation of Build a Molecule simulation.
•	Follow up on Chris M's review of Molecules & Light code.
•	Work on design of Protein Synthesis sim.

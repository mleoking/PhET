/**
 * Light weight actors for Java. Concurrency is controlled by a parallel Strategy.
 * The Strategy serves as the Actor's execution engine, and as its mailbox.
 * <p/>
 * Given some effect, the Actor performs the effect on its messages using its Strategy, transforming them
 * into unit-products. The unit-product represents a possibly running computation which is executing the effect.
 * <p/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> An value of this type may process more than one message at a time, depending on its Strategy,
 * and so is generally not thread safe unless its Effect is. For an actor that processes only one message at a time,
 * see {@link QueueActor}.

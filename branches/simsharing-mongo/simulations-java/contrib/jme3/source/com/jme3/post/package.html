The <code>com.jme3.post</code> package provides utilities for 
render processing.
<p>
The {@link com.jme3.post.SceneProcessor} interface is used as the base interface
for all render processing. The SceneProcessor contains hooks for various rendering
events. 
<p>
One use of render processing is post-processing, which is applying effects
on an already-rendered scene. The engine's post-processing system is implemented
in the {@link com.jme3.post.FilterPostProcessor} class, which contains a list
of {@link com.jme3.post.Filter filters}. Each are invoked in order to apply
various effects on the rendered scene.

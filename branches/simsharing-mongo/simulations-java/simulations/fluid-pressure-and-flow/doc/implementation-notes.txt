Units for this sim are in SI unless noted otherwise.
This simulation uses Property<T> pattern, properties are public and final and use the property name, e.g:
public final Property<Double> mass = new Property<Double>(3.0);

Pressure tab:
Model is trivial, there are no moving parts, see model.txt

Flow tab:
Particles enter the pipe at the left side and flow to the right, see FluidFlowModel.updateParticle
The pipe is modeled as a set of splines through each cross section of the pipe, see Pipe and CrossSection
For the "food coloring" that the user can squirt in, it is modeled as a rectangular perimeter of particles which are propagated according to the same rules as particles
See model.txt regarding negative pressure in Bernoulli's equation

Water tower tab:
Water flows in through the top faucet and out through the hole in the water tower (if open), which may connect to a hose
The speed of the water coming out is sqrt( 2 * g * waterHeight ), see model.txt

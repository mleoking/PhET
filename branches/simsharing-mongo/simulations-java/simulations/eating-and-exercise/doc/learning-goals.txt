Cool. I think a sit down meeting will be best.

My overall reaction is that perhaps we should consider this sim to only model weight gained and lost due to eating and exercise, but not necessarily address health, as it is very broad and depends on too many things. Maybe if we restrict the learning goals to the following (broadly):

- people burn a certain number of calories a day just to stay alive (this is BMR)
- BMR depends roughly on the fat free mass of the person
- exercise burns calories in addition to BMR
- food calories in excess of BMR + exercise turn to fat
- if you eat less than BMR + exercise, you lose weight
- BMI depends on height and weight
- learn roughly how long it takes to lose / gain a certain amount of weight give diet and exercise
- learn that BMI is a rough indicator of health
   (on this last - it may be oversimplifying to specify that heart health depends on BMI..but it is probably OK. Maybe if we include a disclaimer that heart health depends on a number of factors, and BMI is a strong indicator but not the only one.)
- heart health depends on body fat % (added at request of WA)

These focus the learning more on conservation of energy and less on nebulous things like "health". Maybe at some future date, when we have time and input we could make a more involved "health" tab?

Those are my thoughts, having been on this sim for about 3 days.

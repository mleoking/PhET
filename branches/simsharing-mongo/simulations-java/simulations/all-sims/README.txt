All-sims is a meta-project used by an ant task to build a JAR containing all PhET Java simulations.

Currently, "all-sims-build.properties" is created as a temporary output from the ant task, and the
output is placed in deploy/all-sims.jar

Since the list of sims is automatically generated by the build-tools, there is no need to create and use an IML file for this module.

Potential future work: maybe this entire directory structure under "simulations/all-sims" could be automatically generated

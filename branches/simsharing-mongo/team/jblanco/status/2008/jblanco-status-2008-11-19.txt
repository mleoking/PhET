Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign – 18.5 hrs

•	Changed the overall layout of the time chart on the 1st tab to match Noah P’s spec.
•	Added the capability to the time chart to monitor the model and add nuclei and move them on the timeline.
•	Added the capability to the time chart to handle decay events by moving nuclei to lower time line and stopping them.
•	Got Reset All Nuclei and Reset All working for the time chart.
•	Added the half life control slider to the time chart.
•	Reviewed current version with Noah P and Noah H.
•	Added the ability to make the nuclei fall gradually rather than suddenly (more apparent this way).
•	Added to the model the ability to set the half life for the "custom" nucleus.

States of Matter Sim - 10 hrs

•	Did a reasonably thorough regression test.
•	Fixed issues found during regression test.
•	Reviewed several issues found during testing with Noah P (not related to refactoring)
•	Changed chemical transition on 2nd tab to always go to solid phase.
•	Changed the method by which it is decided when the container explodes to be more consistent on different machines.
•	Changed pressure calculation time constant to allow pressure to change more quickly.
•	Fixed an issue where resizing of the adjustable atoms on the 3rd tab was slow and thus causing jerky movement of the slider.

Installer & Web Site – 4 hrs

•	Fixed an issue with images in HTML files for two of the publications.
•	Replaced some publications with updated versions and added & tested redirects.
•	Did some cleanup of the publications directory.

Common Code - 1 hr

•	Added a new version of Spanish strings for common code.
•	Trained Marj on how to do comparisons between new translations and the code base.

Digital Signing (JAR files and Windows executable) - 0.5 hrs

•	Did a little more research.

Meetings & Email - 6 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Normal email overhead.

Upcoming Work

•	Solicit testing of the latest version of SOM, redeploy refactored version when complete.
•	Continue implementation of Alpha Decay Tabbed Redesign.  Major next steps are implementing the jittering of the nuclei, finishing half life, allowing return to bucket, and starting on 2nd tab.
•	Try accounting for gravitational potential energy in SOM (limit to 2 hrs).
•	Work on signing JAR files and Windows EXE files.

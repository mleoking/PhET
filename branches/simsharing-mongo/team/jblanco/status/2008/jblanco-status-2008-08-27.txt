States of Matter Sim - 35 hrs

* Implemented the ability to affect temperature by changing the container size.
* Implemented much of the 3rd and final tab, including the dynamic diagram, movable molecule, and the adjustable atom.
* Modified the liquid transition to always produce a single blob.
* Changed from radio buttons to push buttons for setting the state.
* Tested fragmented container version on Mac and had others do so as well.
* Add the ability to alter the Lennard-Jones parameter values for the potential graph.
* Made it possible to lift lid faster than can push down (requested by Paul B).
* Added code to prevent gradients from being used on Macs, since they were causing crashes.
* Adjusted the sigma and epsilon parameters used for LJ potential to be more realistic for all molecules.
* Tried a number of ways of "Hollywooding" the solid state of water to make it more crystalline.
* Latest version can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/states-of-matter/0.00.36/states-of-matter.jnlp

Nuclear Physics - 0.5 hrs

* Published updated version with button for seeing real reactor core.

Meetings & Email - 3.0 hrs

* Regular weekly status meeting.
* Various discussions with Noah P, Paul B, Sam R, and Kathy in person and via email.

Tools and Infrastructure - 1.5

* Working with IT group on an issue with my email.

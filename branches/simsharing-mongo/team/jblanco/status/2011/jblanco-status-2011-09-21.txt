September 21st, 2011

Time period covered: September 14th through September 21st.

Balance and Torque - 18.0 hrs

•	Fixed bug where in some cases bricks would not appear on plank in the game.
•	Added sound to game.
•	Added +1 and +2 to the feedback faces.
•	Added test to prevent the same question from appearing twice in a single round of the game.
•	Added ruler to the game tab.
•	Eliminated challenges with equal bricks from level 2 of the game tab.
•	Added rocks for use as masses in the game.
•	Published a number of versions for review and for use by the team in Dallas.
•	Performed some initial testing on Mac.
•	Added level 3 challenges to game, which use objects other than bricks.
•	Added 2nd type of challenge, which is one where the user must come up with a numerical value for the mass.
•	Fixed some issues with the scaling of the artwork that represents the people.
•	Made mass labels in the Mass Kit consistent with the ones in the play area.
•	Adjusted the sizes of the people to be more realistic.

Greenhouse Effect - 3.0 hrs

•	Asked Kelly L to review fix for small slider knobs, see #2924.  She spotted an issue which required fixing.
•	Fixed an issue with layout of the 3rd tab.
•	Redeployed fixed version to production server.

Gene Expression Basics - 3.0 hrs

•	Worked on algorithm for causing the mRNA to curl up when synthesized.

Common Code - 3.0 hrs

•	Discussed time units used in common game code - should it be milliseconds or seconds?  See #3067.
•	Added outline text node to common code (from Balance and Torque).
•	Added Arabic and Chinese to test harness in the outline text node to be sure that they look reasonable and to serve as future examples.
•	Responded to questions about using PSwing and controls in the play area.

Installer - 1.0 hr

•	Investigated a report of issues with using the installer in unattended mode on Windows, see #3063.

Miscellaneous - 1.0 hrs

•	Tested launching of our sims on the new 10.7 Mac partition, wrote up results.  It worked fine, see #3069.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 10.0 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Weekly Physics team meeting.
•	Weekly status report.
•	Helped Kathy with the press release announcing the Tech Award.
•	Entered August hours in tracking spreadsheet.
•	Review, prioritization, and updating of Unfuddle issues - spend extra time on this in order to get a bit caught up on the backlog.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 1.0 hrs

•	Left early on 9/15/2011.

What’s Next

•	Continue developing Balance & Torque simulation - finish game, move towards initial publication.
•	Continue developing Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue developing States of Matter: Basics.

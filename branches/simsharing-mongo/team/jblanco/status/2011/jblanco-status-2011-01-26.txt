PhET Weekly Progress Report

Time period covered: January 20th through January 26th.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 12.5 hrs

•	Reviewed with chemistry group, made a list of requested changes.
•	Made small amounts of an isotope say "very small" for its abundance (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Made the symbol have a larger font for the name (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Modified the symbol to include the isotope number in the element name, e.g. Hydrogen-2 (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Fixed the titles.
•	Enlarged the neutron bucket.
•	Added a white background to the legend.
•	Made the bottom of the periodic table be non-buttons.
•	Added sketch of 2nd tab to the tab itself.
•	Published a version for review.
•	Worked on software design of the 2nd tab.
•	Sketched the higher-density version of the 2nd tab and circulated for review.
•	Met with Kelly to discuss some further modifications to layout of 1st tab and basic operation of 2nd tab.

Molecules and Light - 8.0 hrs

•	Made the energy arrows non-interactive.
•	Put photons on the top of the selector buttons.
•	Modified energy arrow to be a single arrow at the bottom center of the control panel.
•	Reviewed with chemistry group, made a list of requested changes.
•	Created a sketch of the spectrum diagram (in collaboration with Kelly).
•	Slowed rotation induced by microwaves to avoid the impression that it is higher energy.
•	Met with Kelly to discuss some modifications.
•	Published version for feedback.

Common Code - 2.5 hrs

•	Investigated issue of small slider knob on Win Vista and Win 7, implemented and tested a potential fix.  See Unfuddle #2682.
•	Created a small test app to compare different slider looks on different systems, collected date from various OSes and logged into the bug report (#2682).

Environment - 10.0

•	Got phet-server configured to automatically start up VNC, SVN mirror, Unfuddle Notifier, and Tomcat starting automatically upon a system restart (in collaboration with Jonathan O), see Unfuddle #2689.
•	Worked with Sam on the idea of getting the Unfuddle Notifier to run headless so that it can be started remotely.
•	Investigated an issue with the audio on Camtasia with Kelly L.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 7.0 hrs

•	Updated simulation pipeline document.
•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Nothing on the immediate horizon.

What’s Next

•	Finish initial version of 2nd tab of the Isotopes sim.
•	Make final tweaks to and then publish Molecules and Light.
•	Collaborate with Kathy on the design of some new biology simulations.
•	Research and order new PC.

PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
December 8, 2010

Molecules and Light - 16 hrs

•	Designed and prototyped the "break apart" behavior (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Met with the Chemistry Team to review user interface and responses of molecules to photons.
•	Added an API to the Molecule class to support vibration, rotation, excitation, and break apart.
•	Implemented a Strategy Pattern for handling photon absorption, implemented vibration, rotation, and excitation strategies (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Worked on the design of the Return Atom feature.
•	Partially implemented the break apart behavior.
•	Regression tested Photon Absorption tab on the Greenhouse sim.

Build an Atom (Most of this work done in collaboration with Sam R) - 4.5 hrs

•	Met with the Chemistry Team to review the latest changes to the game.
•	Worked on the nucleus reconfiguration algorithm so that Lithium-6 and Lithium-7 are more distinct.
•	Replaced the original prototype implementation of the unstable nucleus animation with a more production-ready version.
•	Cleaned up the vast majority of TODOs in the code.
•	Published a new version as a release candidate.

Buoyancy - 4.0 hrs (in collaboration with Sam R)

•	Made the density indicator readout show up just below the indicator itself.
•	Changed the user interface for selecting My Block to be a radio button.
•	Worked on offsetting the force vectors from the center of the block so that they don't overlap.
•	Offset the numerical indicators associated with the force vectors.

Isotope - 2.0 hrs

•	Met with Chemistry Group to review the latest set of drawings.
•	Modified 2nd tab based on chem group meeting.
•	Put the Adobe Illustrator files that are being used to sketch the tabs into SVN.

Neuron - 2.0 hrs

•	Prepare for post mortem.
•	Participate in post mortem.

Interviews - 2.5 hrs

•	Attended presentation by and then interviewed a candidate for a post-doc position.

Installers - 1.5 hrs

•	Checked that the blog looked okay on the auto-generated installer version (as did Marj).
•	Updated the User Agent values used when ripping Arabic web site.
•	Verified that recent changes to JNLP files will not affect the installer.

Customer Support - 1.0 hrs

•	Wrote up FAQ for running PhET sims from a USB Flash drive.
•	Wrote up FAQ that explains the PhET name.

Environment - 0.5 hrs

•	Upgraded Intellij to the latest release version.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET team meetings.
•	Wrote up and circulated notes from the Chemistry Team meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Will be taking some time over the holidays, as yet TBD.

What’s Next

•	Finish Build an Atom, publish to dev.
•	Finish Molecules & Light and publish a release candidate.
•	Continue the draw-review cycle on Isotope.
•	Set up the Isotope simulation and start code development.
•	Implement any changes resulting from interviews on Membrane Channels (if conducted).

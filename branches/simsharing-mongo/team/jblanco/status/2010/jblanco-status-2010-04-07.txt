PhET Weekly Progress Report

Neuron Sim - 16.0 hrs

•	Summary: Work was done on a lot of little issues in preparation for having the Axon tab ready for review with the IPhy people.
•	Made ions avoid the inactivation gate when moving through a dual-gated channel.
•	Made ions bounce if inside a dual-gated channel when the inactivation gate closes.
•	Increased the amount of Brownian motion for the bulk ions when visible.
•	Internal cleanup - removed voltmeter left over from early incarnations.
•	Made the inactivation gate be a exponential function instead of simple linear so that it will appear to snap shut more quickly.
•	Updated legend panel to match the set of channels now showing on the membrane in the play area.
•	Made the “Reset All” functionality work.
•	Mapped the flow through the potassium leak channel to the leak current in the Hodgkin-Huxley model.  This required some "Hollywooding" and needs to be reviewed with Noah P.

Lac Operon - 15.0 hrs

•	Summary: Working to finish 2nd tab and to release version 1.0.
•	Organized a meeting with Kathy P and Noah P where we reviewed current status and decided whether to go ahead with the additional tabs.  The decision for now is to release this after the 1st two tabs are complete.
•	Added the ability to manually move LacY to the membrane and place it there.
•	Added code to prevent LacY from being manually removed from the membrane.
•	Made the background color different for inside vs. outside the cell membrane.
•	Added a label to the lactose injector on the first tab.
•	Reproportioned the tool box based on feedback received during last PhET team meeting.
•	Added DNA and LacY to the legend.
•	Added code to prevent model elements from being manually moved across the membrane or out of the model area.
•	Published a version to dev for review and feedback.
•	Reviewed with Noah P.

Miscellaneous Issues - 3.5

•	Worked on issue with JSliders having knobs in weird places on certain versions of Mac OS (Unfuddle #1619) - Set up the Big Mac OS X 10.6 partition to be able to build from the SVN repository, tested Quantum Wave Interference, was able to duplicate problem.  Rebuilt against Piccolo 1.3 + PSwing changes to see if fixed, but this did not resolve issue.  Continuing to investigate.
•	Improved cascading of constructors for GradientButtonNode based on feedback from Chris M (see Unfuddle #2249).
•	Helped Marj with getting Reactants, Products, and Leftovers working on several test machines.  This was needed for some interviews.

Development Environment - 0.5

•	Implemented a template in Eclipse for making it easier to dump variables during debug.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

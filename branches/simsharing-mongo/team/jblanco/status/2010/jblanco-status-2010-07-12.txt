Greenhouse - 21.0 hrs

•	Added the ability to emit photons to the model and mapped to the view.
•	Added the ability to select photon emission type (Visible or IR).
•	Investigated using JMOL as a library for representing molecules, decided against.
•	Added model and view representations for atoms, bonds, and molecules.
•	Created carbon dioxide molecule.
•	Added initial oscillation for carbon dioxide.
•	Published a version for initial feedback, let Kelly L and Robert P know about it.
•	Incorporated atom sizes and bond lengths provided by Kelly, have had to extend bonds to make the visible.
•	Discussed possible ways to represent transfer of kinetic energy from CO2 to O2 and N2 with Kelly L and Noah P.
•	Implemented photon absorption and emission by CO2.
•	Added the ability to place molecules on the control panel.
•	Various improvements to the layout of the play area.

Neuron – 10.0 hrs

•	Met with Noah P to work through exactly where membrane channels and ions should be during each stage of the action potential.
•	Implemented changes to make channels and ions behave more correctly at each state of AP.
•	Published a version for review and feedback.

Installer Builder for Wicket-Based Web Site - 0.5 hrs

•	Talked with JO about putting random sim in the "prime spot" on the home page in the installer.

Common Code - 0.5 hrs

•	Collaborated with Sam on an issue with turning Piccolo nodes into images.

Customer Support - 1.0 hrs

•	Got set up on Putnum's Mastering Physics web site, investigated problem with launching Java sims, found that they were linking to JAR file instead of JNLP.

Environment - 0.5

•	Set up tools for remote collaboration (TeamView).

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.5 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting
•	Annual performance review meeting
•	Set up better filtering for email messages.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0.0 hrs

•	Upcoming vacation from July 29 - August 10

What’s Next

•	Finish implementation of all individual molecules on the Photon Absorption tab of Greenhouse.
•	Work out how to represent air in the Photon Absorption tab of Greenhouse.
•	Support student interviews on Neuron.
•	Continue port to Piccolo of existing tabs in Greenhouse.
•	Continue work on Membrane Diffusion sim.

Radiometric Dating Game – 19.5 hrs

•	Made tree not radiometrically age until it appears fully dead.
•	Made "Kill Tree" and "Cool Rock" buttons cause instantaneous change, rather than previous speedup behavior.
•	Made the probe work only when touching the object, rather than its full rectangle (in collaboration with Sam).
•	Added a time readout to the 3rd tab.
•	Made time start off slow in the Aging Rock animation, then speed up, so as not to create the illusion that eruptions occur for millions of years.
•	Added the name of the item whose age is being guessed to the guessing dialog (in collaboration with Sam).
•	Published a version to dev for review and requested (and obtained) feedback.

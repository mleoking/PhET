PhET Weekly Progress Report

Lac Operon Sim - 23.0 hrs

•	Made the RNA polymerase bump up against the LacI when blocked.  It does this multiple times to make it clear to users that it is block from traversing.
•	Implemented better handling of removal of items on the DNA strand when they are interacting with other macromolecules in the cell.
•	Changed the motion algorithm for the macromolecules so that it doesn't get so crowded around the DNA strand.
•	Made the lactose injector not show up until there is something for lactose to interact with.  After it appears it stays until a reset occurs.
•	Added a legend and a control for turning it on and off.
•	Implemented a way for DNA to be visible in the background of the genes and other DNA strand components.  However, this didn't look that good, so this has been turned off but kept in the code in case it is needed.
•	Reviewed progress with Noah P, made several small changes based on review and am in the progress of implementing the larger ones.
•	Started implementing code for making the RNA Polymerase transcribe mRNA for LacI, instead of having the LacI gene generate it spontaneously as it does now.

Neuron - 1.0 hrs

•	Discussed model and user interface plans with Noah P.

Greenhouse - 4.0 hrs

•	Changed the way in which simulation speed is controlled so that the speed does not affect the temperature.  This resolves an issue reported by Kathy P, see Unfuddle #2038.
•	Redeployed to dev for review.

Development Environment and Tools - 2.0 hrs

•	Worked with Sam to resolve an issue with the Unfuddle notifier.  This issue should now be fully resolved and is not expected to require any more time in the short term.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Two weekly PhET meetings (12/17 and 12/22).
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Holidays, Vacation, and Sick Leave - 4.0 hrs

•	Took a half day of sick time on Thursday, Dec 17th.

Tools for monitoring data as it is being collected by the server and for converting MongoDB data to text files for researchers to use.
I split this into a separate project because it uses Scala code from the simsharing-analysis module and I wanted to keep Scala projects separate from Java projects.
If sim-event-data-collection-server starts to use scala, this project can be merged with it.

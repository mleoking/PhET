/**
 * This class is a workaround for sims that have a problem resizing, see #2860.
 * The strategy is to sample the canvas size to ApparatusPanel2 and print out the reference size set by the TransformManager.
 * Then that reference size is provided as width x height for this constructor, and that value is used for the reference size.

Here is Linda’s response:

         About the sim, I tried to go back to look at it to remind myself of the history, but I couldn't find it.  I think it was an earlier version of what became Reversibe Reactions, but it was more general, just two boxes with balls bouncing around in them, and you could change the size of the opening between the boxes.

I am a little fuzzy on the details, but I think this was a simulation that Carl Lineberger suggested, as it allowed him to show how in a molecular beam experiment, changing the size of the opening allowed you to select an atom (in experiments it would be a molecule, but in the sim it looked like an atom, a single sphere) with a specific direction for velocity.  I am guessing the reason the sim was made obsolete is that it doesn't stand on its own, for in-class activities.  I think most parameters aren't labelled, so students might be disoriented about what is going on.  I think it could be useful as a demonstration in class, supported with explanation from the instructor.  I do not think molecular beams are covered in high school classes (unless they are way more advanced than I was, which is possible) and so the sim was probably considered to have a very limited audience.  But diffusion is a big topic in chemistry, and maybe the sim should just be considered a diffusion sim.  I don't think it is obsolete so much as underdeveloped.  It may be hard though, to make the sim show more information about experiments which would involve more complicated molecules.

  The chemistry sims seem to get burdened with loads of ideas all in one sim.  The sim is simple (If I'm remembering the right one), but simple can be good.

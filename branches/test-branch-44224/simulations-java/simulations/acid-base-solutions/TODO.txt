TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

DESIGN ISSUES
- differentiate between initial and equilibrium concentration
- address generic symbols in reaction equations (A,B,M)

HIGH PRIORITY

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- pH paper can be lost behind magnifying glass or concentration graph (disable Views?)
- confusion between pH paper and graph bars by allowing them to be shown at the same time (disable Views?)

LOW PRIORITY

MIGRATE TO COMMON

A list of Piccolo changes/enhancements that would be useful to PhET

- nodes that are invisible should not be pickable (currently handled by PhetPNode)

- PNode setters should test to see if the value has really changed (some support in PhetPNode)
    -in many applications, this leads to performance improvements

- don't throw exception if you call removeChild with a node that is not a child

- resolve quirks in the relationship between PCanvas, PLayer, PCamera

- copies vs references of Point2D, etc

- methods for changing coordinate frame currently have an arg that is both input and output

- add methods to test parent-child and parent-ancestor relationship between 2 nodes

- allow PNode to check for existence of PropertyChangeListeners

- notification for change to any property of a node

- property changes on a subtree

- extension via services

- support for testing and assertions

- add method addChild() to PCanvas, with default implementation getLayer().addChild()

- layout nodes, to specify the spacial relationship between a set of nodes, dynamically manages layout

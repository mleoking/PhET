PhET Weekly Progress Report

Neuron - 17.5

•	Made motion of atoms through channels appear more random.
•	Added a hysteresis mechanism to prevent atoms from moving too quickly back and forth through the channels.
•	Added capability to change the relative concentration of atoms (outside membrane vs inside membrane).
•	Added user interface (sliders) for controlling the concentration.
•	Made the strings on the control panel into translatable resources.
•	Changed the algorithm for distributing the channels to make them equidistant, rather than randomly located.
•	Changed the algorithm for initial distribution of atoms inside the membrane to make them closer to the membrane.
•	Changed the shape of the Potassium atoms to match what seems to be the convention in text books.
•	Refactoring and cleanup for improved maintainability.
•	Discussed several issues and ideas for modifications with Noah P.
•	Published (twice) for initial feedback.

KSU Installer - 9.0

•	Added the "stubbed" installer to the list of ripped items, worked with Jonathan to get stubbed versions on the web site.
•	Added steps to include the local-mirror installers in the web mirror installer.
•	Started work on incorporating the distribution tag.
•	Worked with Sam R to do some additional testing and to get him familiar with this installer builder.
•	Testing and fixing of issues discovered, cleanup of the code.

The Ramp - 3.5

•	Collaborated with Sam to remove the controls on the velocity, acceleration, and position graphs (leaving controls only on the force graph).
•	Collaborated with Sam on refactoring to clean up issues with reuse of classes in The Ramp in the Moving Man sim.
•	Tested on the Mac platform, logged one issue as a result.

Web Site and (non-KSU) Installer - 4.0 hrs

•	Investigated a report of problems with the Linux installer, provided suggested questions for the user (see Unfuddle #1802).
•	Incorporated latest update of Java 5.0 into the Windows installer (Version 1.5.0_21).

Miscellaneous - 1.0

•	Spent some time learning Microsoft OneNote, planning to use this as a place to track notes on simulation design and implementation.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

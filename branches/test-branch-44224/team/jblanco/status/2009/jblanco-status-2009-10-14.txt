PhET Weekly Progress Report

Neuron - 22.0 hrs

•	Changed particle distribution so that particles are evenly distributed in the space inside and outside of the membrane (instead of clustered near the membrane).
•	Got the voltage potential chart partially working.
•	Replaced the voltage potential chart with a prototype voltmeter (based on feedback from Noah P).
•	Generalized the current model to handle various particle configurations.
•	Implemented a new tab that has potassium and negatively charged proteins.
•	Removed markings from ions in the play area, created a legend on the control panel.
•	Reduced the size of the ions and added more of them.
•	Added an electric field gradient that causes particles outside the membrane to move in the appropriate direction based on the membrane potential.
•	Profiled and did some optimizations so that the particle motion doesn't take up too much processor power.
•	Met with Noah P to review most recent version in preparation for meeting with Integrative Physiology people.

KSU Installer - 8.5 hrs

•	Added CSS modifications created by Jonathan that removes the unneeded links (such as the links to the downloadable installers) from the local mirror.
•	Worked with Jonathan on some other CSS changes for removing the Download button from the local mirror.
•	Added time stamping of the JAR files.  Note that since this requires contact with an outside server, it increases the time to recreate the installer to a little over four hours.
•	Set up IIS sever on one of the PhET Windows machine as a test platform.
•	Tested the installer on a windows server, made a number of changes/fixes based on the results.
•	Added the distribution tag to the version file.
•	Did a fairly thorough test of the web mirror and local mirror running under IIS.  Only one minor issue found, which has since been resolved.
•	Created a Google document with a testing checklist for the installer.  This will help us to more methodically verify future versions.
•	Sent out a list of work that is outside of my control that needs to be done to complete the first installer, sent to Wendy and Jonathan for review.

Installer (non-KSU version) - 3.0 hrs

•	Support of the guy in Australia that was having installer issues (#1820).  He was ultimately able to download and install successfully.
•	Tracked down and resolved yet another issue where insufficient disk space on Tigercat caused the weekly automated build to fail.

Miscellaneous - 1.5 hrs

•	Tested and verified the functionality implemented by Chris M for sending stats from Java sims when run from other (i.e. non-phet) web sites.
•	Checked the SVN mirror that is maintained on phet-sever (this SVN mirror is our own backup of the Unfuddle code repository).

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

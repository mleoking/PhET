Membrane Channels - 16 hrs

•	Renamed to Membrane Channels from Membrane Diffusion.
•	Fixed bug with particles going outside bounds after crossing channel.
•	Implemented the changes suggested in the last PhET team meeting, including:
o	Swapped the order of channels in the tool boxes.
o	Changed red particles and channels to be green.
o	Removed dialog for full membrane, replaced with animation back to tool box.
o	Removed dialog for full particle chamber, just doesn't add any more particles or allow button to depress.
o	Tested color blindness compatibility for new color scheme.
•	Investigated programmatic generation of channel icons on the control button to allow easier color changes, but decided against due to the time it would take.
•	Integrated new icons for channel open/close supplied by Noah P.
•	Made buttons on the control panel be disabled unless they have something in the play area to control.
•	Published a new version for review and feedback.

Greenhouse - 15.5 hrs

•	Removed and archived the tab that was partially ported to Piccolo in case we ever decide to do this.
•	Fixed issue with the 2nd tab where the background appeared to be displaced (seen during last team meeting).
•	Removed custom vector implementations and now use common code.
•	Made atmosphere readouts not appear to be editable, since previous interviews found that people tried to change these.
•	Changed layout of the panel on the Greenhouse Effect tab so that the atmosphere concentration readout is not moving between the radio buttons.
•	Made the "Show All Photons" check box be off by default.
•	Changed to use the new PhetTitledPanel on the control panel.
•	Removed all unused images from SVN.  This will reduce the size of the JAR files.
•	Set up the Photon Absorption tab for internationalization.
•	Worked with Sam R on an issue where making the sim window large could cause memory exceptions.
•	Created a new flavor with different tab ordering.  Kelly L is planning to use this in upcoming interviews.
•	Published a new version to dev to support interviews.

Common Code - 0.5 hrs

•	Added comments to Unfuddle issue about PhetTitledPanel and PhetTitledBorder, which are now being used in Greenhouse and Membrane Channels.

Miscellaneous - 2.0

•	Contacted science teacher at Southern Hills Middle School about using some sims, since the curriculum (which I saw presented at a back-to-school night) had some good opportunities for sim use.
•	"De-gunked" my PC in order to improve performance, seems substantially better.
•	Verified that the SVN mirror process is working correctly on phet-server.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Will be out on Thursday and Friday of this week, September 2nd & 3rd.
•	Monday, September 6th, is a holiday.

What’s Next

•	Work with Noah P to finalize Membrane Diffusion and support interviews on it.
•	Start on next sim.

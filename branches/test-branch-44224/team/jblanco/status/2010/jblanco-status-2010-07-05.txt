•	Completed adding support of record and playback of the particle positions.
•	Added support for record and playback of charge information.
•	Added support for record and playback of internal and external ion concentration information.
•	Tested the record-and-feedback feature and fixed all minor issues found.
•	Published a version for review and feedback.

Greenhouse - 2.0 hrs

•	Created initial, mostly stubbed out version of the Photon Absorption model and integrated it with the view.

CCK - 1.0 hr

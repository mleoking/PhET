Nuclear Physics Sim - 32 hrs

* Changed alpha radiation behavior to be an exponential decay function (which
  is more real world).

  occurs.
* Got labels working on the nuclei for both the play area and the legend.
* Added first cut of Decay Time Strip Chart discussed in last week's meeting.
* Added Neutron Gun and dynamic nucleus to the "Fission: One Nucleus" tab.

Training and Ramping Up - 5 hrs

* Continuing to ramp up, i.e. becoming more familiar with the established code
  base, the Java APIs, and the tools and environment.

Meetings - 3 hrs

* Regular weekly status meeting

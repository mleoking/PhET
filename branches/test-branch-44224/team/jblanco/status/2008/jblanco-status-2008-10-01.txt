States of Matter Sim - 24.5 hrs

•	Implemented Mac-safe stove node.
•	Resolved issues with using round gradients to depict spherical particles on Mac platform.
•	Fixed issues with post-explosion particle behavior.
•	Changed gradient on the Interaction Potential to look reasonable with the push pin.
•	Implemented logarithmic scale for mapping model pressure on to phase diagram.
•	Incorporated new temperature-to-phase diagram mappings supplied by Noah P.
•	Changed the way pressure was calculated - now uses more of the container than just the lid, and is more responsive as a result.
•	Made the pressure drop more quickly after container explodes.
•	Implemented a bunch of other relatively minor UI changes requested by various reviewers.
•	Currently working with Paul B. and Noah P. to finalize phase diagram behavior.

Nuclear Physics - 4.0

•	Posted new Alpha Radiation and Nuclear Physics sims, including new abstracts.

Web Site – 2.0

•	Implemented redirects for renamed flash sims.

Meetings & Email - 3.5 hrs

•	Regular weekly status meeting.
•	Sim tracking meeting.
•	Various discussions with Noah P, Paul B, Sam R, and Kathy in person and via email.

Tools and Infrastructure - 6.0 hrs

•	Set up installer development area on Tigercat to point to Unfuddle repository.
•	Got set up to use IntelliJ as an alternative to Eclipse due to issues with Eclipse-SVN integration.
•	Set up Eclipse on the Mac to point to the Unfuddle repository.
•	Updated the Mac to the latest Java version.

States of Matter Sim - 21.5 hrs

•	Added the ability to display force arrows on the atoms in Interaction Potential tab.
•	Lined up the atom positions with the interaction potential graph on the Interaction Potential tab.
•	Scaled the interaction potential graph & atoms so that the motion on graph matches that of the atoms.
•	Added "Stop Atom" button to the Interaction Potential tab that allows users to stop the atom and then move it to a new position.
•	Made the "blob" that is formed when directly transition to liquid to be lower in the container and closer to where the solid resides (suggested at last meeting).
•	Improved the look of the buttons for forcing state transitions.
•	Latest version can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/states-of-matter/0.00.39/states-of-matter.jnlp

•	Worked with Sam R. to resolve several outstanding issues that were listed as high priority in Unfuddle.

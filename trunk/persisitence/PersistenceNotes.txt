Notes on Persistence using XMLEncoder/Decoder
=============================================

There are classes in the JDK that don't provide sufficient Java Beans compliance to be used as-is.
    Point2D
I've creeated a wrapper class, PersistentPoint2D that works.

ApparatusPanel doesn't save/restore properly right now, so I have to save/restore its GraphicLayerSet's
MultiMap, and setting the component for everything in the MultiMap upon restore.

Are all items in the GraphicLayerSet's MultiMap PhetGraphics that should point to the ApparatusPanel?

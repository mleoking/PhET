SingleSourceModule should be refactored out

Do the interference amplitude determination in the model, not the view (InterferenceListenerGraphic)

the way ListenerGraphic computes it's model coordinates isn't quite right. See ListenerGraphic.translate()

Put a Speaker class in the model

When octave is displayed, scale the amplitude displayed so that when primary amp is max'ed, and octave amp is 0, display is still max'ed

replace Iterators with better mechanism

SoundApparatusPanel.LISTENER_SOURCE and related constants should be moved to a model class

individual widgets in the control panel should be SimpleObservers of the model elements they work with

Octave wavefront is generating even when it's not enabled. Should it?

MyOscillator priority is max priority. Bring this down

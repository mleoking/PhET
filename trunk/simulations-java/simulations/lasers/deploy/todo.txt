8-24-2007 bug report from McKagan
Also, I found a bug in Lasers.  It's there in the old version, and no one's ever complained about it before, so it's probably not a high priority to fix, but it's worth at least documenting it.  Here's how you reproduce it:
1. Get it lasing.
2. Set lower transition from photon view to wave view.  There should be
  a big wave going.
3. Move energy level 1 up or down so that it's now lasing in a different color.  The wave will immediately change color even though most of the photons in the laser are still the old color (this is a little weird, but I don't know how else it could behave, so it's probably fine).
4. Wait a few seconds and then switch back to photon view.  All the photons in the laser cavity are gone!  Where did they go?  The wave view
  and the laser power meter still indicate that they're in there, but you can't see them.

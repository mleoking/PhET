Then if he hits play it's back up to 80-100%. So the sim is still running after the laser blows up.

2.  This one is related to Sam's bug that she found and a problem associated with the fact that we don't address the concept that the
chamber has to be an integral number of wavelengths to work.  So he will get a laser of one color (in photon view)
and then move the lower energy level.  It quickly builds up photons of the new color and is lasing in the new color
while there are still a large number of photons of the old color still oscillating and lasing.  See attached screen shot.
We might want to do something simple like reset when a person moves the lower energy level while lasing.


8-24-2007 bug report from McKagan
Also, I found a bug in Lasers.  It's there in the old version, and no one's ever complained about it before,
so it's probably not a high priority to fix, but it's worth at least documenting it.  Here's how you reproduce it:
1. Get it lasing.
2. Set lower transition from photon view to wave view.  There should be
  a big wave going.
3. Move energy level 1 up or down so that it's now lasing in a different color.
The wave will immediately change color even though most of the photons in the laser are
still the old color (this is a little weird, but I don't know how else it could behave, so it's probably fine).
4. Wait a few seconds and then switch back to photon view.  All the photons in the laser
cavity are gone!  Where did they go?  The wave view
  and the laser power meter still indicate that they're in there, but you can't see them.

9/9/11 Deploying snapshot for testing prior to adding game tab
Added two more people to the list of those that can be put on the teeter totter.
Made the highlight for occupied tick marks white.
Added "mystery vectors" that are shown instead of normal force vectors for mystery objects.
Added a 2nd set of mystery objects.
Fixed an issue where mystery objects were not positioned well under the mouse when created from the tool box.
Fixed an issue where a model element would be added and animated forever if the user just did one quick click on the item in the tool box.
Added highlights for the occupied tick marks on the plank.
Fixed an issue where the plank could keep moving when the supports were added back.
Made the mass labels appear over the center of mass for the images, instead of just the image center.
Fixed a bug where some of the control checkboxes were not cleared upon a Reset All.

Removed, at least for now, the 2nd tab.
Made the plank so that the user can grab and tip it manually.
Made the mass labels on shapes into two lines for better readability.
Removed tick marks from bottom of ruler and added units label instead.
Made the ruler transparent.
Made the attachment bar very short - essentially looks like plank is just below the pivot.
Enlarged and finalized the level indicators.

8/15/11 Publishing to dev for review by design team.
Moved x's on bottoms of support columns so that the won't be overlapped by the ruler.
Removed distance vectors (a.k.a. lever arms).
Added the snap-on ruler for showing distances.
Added mass labels and the ability to turn them on/off.
Added labels for the mystery objects.
Added animation for the removal of masses from the plank.
Made the items grabbed from the teeter totter be positioned under the mouse (they were off in some cases).
Fixed issues with humans not being positioned where the center of balance is.
Fixed issue where items could be added to center of plank.
Initial usage of KitSelectionNode

8/3/11 Publishing updated version to dev for review.
Improved placement of the control panels.
Moved columns so that the red x wouldn't be overlapped by force vectors.
Made it easier to place masses on the plank by using the center point rather than the bottom of the mass.
Added distance vectors.
Made the plank motion settle out more quickly (i.e. it oscillates less before becoming still).
Hooked up vector visibility to control panel.
Added vectors due to masses on the planks.

8/1/11 Deploying to dev for review at weekly meeting
Added control panel for vectors (but not the actual vectors yet).
Fixed: blocks look like they are sliding along the plank surface

Improved layout for block control panel
Added title to block control panel
Added "previous/next" buttons to control panel
Added handling for the removal of weights (currently on brick stacks) from the model, and made it so that stacks are removed if they are ever released anywhere other than over the plank.

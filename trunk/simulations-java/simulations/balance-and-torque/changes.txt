Moved x's on bottoms of support columns so that the won't be overlapped by the ruler.
Removed distance vectors (a.k.a. lever arms).
Added the snap-on ruler for showing distances.
Added mass labels and the ability to turn them on/off.
Added labels for the mystery objects.
Added animation for the removal of masses from the plank.
Made the items grabbed from the teeter totter be positioned under the mouse (they were off in some cases).

Moved columns so that the red x wouldn't be overlapped by force vectors.
Made it easier to place masses on the plank by using the center point rather than the bottom of the mass.
Added distance vectors.
Made the plank motion settle out more quickly (i.e. it oscillates less before becoming still).
Hooked up vector visibility to control panel.
Added vectors due to masses on the planks.

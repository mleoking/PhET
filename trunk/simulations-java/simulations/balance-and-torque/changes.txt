Made the mass deduction challenges start off in the balanced state rather than requiring the user to balance them.
Interspersed the "Deduce the Mass" challenges in with the balance challenges at all levels of the game.

Made the plank so that the user can grab and tip it manually.
Made the mass labels on shapes into two lines for better readability.
Removed tick marks from bottom of ruler and added units label instead.

11/2/11 Deploying to dev for review.

# 0.00.16 (58042) Oct 26, 2011
10/26/11 Deploying to dev for feedback and review.
Fixed an issue where the center of gravity could be off for some of the masses used on the game tab.
Made sure all masses fit between the two tick marks to the right and left of their position on the balance.
Added a constraint to the multi-mass challenges so that the fixed masses are at least two "ticks" apart.  This prevents issues with overlapping.
Added a key handler on the game tab so that the user can move between steps of the challenges using the Enter key.
Added a small trash can mass object, which is being used in the first tab so as not to give away mass of medium trash can, which is being used as a mystery mass in the game.
Changed show label from "Ruler" to "Rulers", since the ruler was split into two a while back.
# 0.00.15 (57885) Oct 21, 2011
10/21/11 Deploying to dev for review and feedback.

Removed the "F" label from the fire extinguisher.

9/30/11 Deploying to dev for interviews and feedback from design team.
Added a set of mystery masses that the user will not have seen by the time they get to the game.  We will need a bunch more of these.

Got "Reset All" to return bricks to original position on the ground on the Intro tab.
Made it possible to place bricks on the ground anywhere on the Intro tab.
Changed names of the first two tabs to "Intro" and "Balance Lab".

Added multiple mass balance challenges.  For now, these are on level 4 only.
Made the mass deduction challenges back to being initially interactive, i.e. user must balance the plank.
Made the mass labels for the mystery masses into a question mark instead of just leaving them blank.
# 0.00.12 (56970) Sep 26, 2011

Made the mass deduction challenges start off in the balanced state rather than requiring the user to balance them.
Interspersed the "Deduce the Mass" challenges in with the balance challenges at all levels of the game.
Added more ratios for the "Deduce the Mass" challenges so that there are easier and harder versions of this challenge.
Fixed an issue where the fixed masses in the 2nd level challenges could end up on the right side.
Made the bold tick marks on the plank be every other one rather than every fourth one.

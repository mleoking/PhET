8-10-2007: Bugfixes for Mac OS X + Java 1.4

7-19-2007:
a. On the right control panel, if you show more controls, they are grayed out often. The only way to get access is to click on the Force diagram window. The pattern for changing to gray was not obvious to me, and I don't see this on the web version.
b. The vertical bar on the graphs goes out of site, if you leave the experiment run longer than the window. One time the vertical line was not visible in one graph, but was in the rest. I couldn't reproduce the behavior, but it happened when I reset to defaults.

Force1D Known Bugs (in order of severity):
•	Chris says force1d doesn’t run on a Mac.
•	Wall force doesn’t appear during playback.
•	Adding barriers during a recording session has the wrong behavior on playback.

I just ran the version of Force1D that's on the PhET website.
Sim version is v1r4, Mac OS 10.3.9, Java 1.4.2_09.

The control panel has serious problems when "More Controls"
is pressed, see attached snapshot.  Combobox contents are
clipped, and I assume there are a bunch of missing sliders?...

FYI, the Ramp has the same combobox problem, and some buttons that 
require setOpaque(false).

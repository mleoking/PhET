1-9-2009: #821, improper sharing of clocks between modules
10-8-2008: convert to new PhetApplicationConfig framework

New in 3.08.06 (10-8-2008)
>Removed unnecessary help items from reversible reactions sim 

7-19-2007: converted particle count spinners to value based instead of difference based

3.05.07 (6-8-2007)
(same as 3.05.05)

3.05.05 (6-8-2007)
Renamed 'advanced-gas' to 'reversible-reactions'
Trial fix for "molecules stick to right wall and pass through left wall" bug in reversible-reactions module.
    -This fix may have introduced other issues in the simulation
    -The existence of this bug may be indicative of other similar bugs, which may need more work

3.05.04 (6-6-2007)
Fixes for the energy histogram: added scroll bars, made resizable, made it not expand taller than the screen height. 

3.05.03 (6-5-2007)
Fixed: Checking the energy histogram option doesn't do anything

3/4/05
Added Options menu with Advanced Options menu item
Several old features are now only accessible if this option is selected
Two new modules are provided with this option.
Changes in localized strings
MeasurementControlPanel.No_particle_interactions  no longer used. It is replaced with MeasurementControlPanel.Molecules-interact.
Changed strings that label the x axes of histograms

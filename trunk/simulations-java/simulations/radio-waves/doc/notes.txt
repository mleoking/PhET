The EmfApplicationGI takes a command line parameter that is the class name of
the guided inquiry. This does not work the way I had done it before, where the
GIs are named in the JNLP extension file. This way will work better for wrapping
the app-GI in an external thing.

Moved things away from using commands in the GuidedInquiry stuff.

Added methods to PhetApplication and ModuleManager named activateModuleOfClass(). Needed
for GI.

I will need to get access to the frame from the application, or the application will
have to become aware of the GuidedInquiry stuff, so dialogs get rendered properly.

Modal dialogs are created and put up within exercise state classes. Non modal information
is presented in the GIDialog class. Should try to put these all together, I think.

Created GraphicsUtil.centerWindowOnScreen();



To Do
-----
Hook up, enable and test the module-switching code.

Send frame around as parameter, so dialogs can be centered on screen.

Create a first-encounter dialog.

Figure out how to do external questions, and post results.

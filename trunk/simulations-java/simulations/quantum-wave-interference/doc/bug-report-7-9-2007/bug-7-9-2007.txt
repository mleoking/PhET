Hi Sam,

Here's a bug report on QWI.  I checked it out and the behavior is really weird.  I don't think this is a top priority, given that the problem only happens at high resolution and we have so much to get done for AAPT, but it's worth taking a look at at some point.

Hi Sam,

I received this email this morning and thought it appropriate to send to you. Please let me know if I should be sending the Quantum sims questions to you or to another source (I am still learning the ropes).
Thanks!
Angie

In this applet, when the mode is set to single particles, and the resolution is set to high, the waves behave strangely. The wave will travel forward normally for some time, but then all of a sudden it will just "die". It seems to fade out of existence. It happens regardless of the various settings I change like the "rapid" check box and the time step. This happens on all computers I've tried it on, so I suspect there is something wrong with the applet. I attached an image showing the wave while it still appears normal and another showing it as it is fading away.

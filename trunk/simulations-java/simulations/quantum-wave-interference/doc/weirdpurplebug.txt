Remember this bug: "If I move the wavelength slider all the way to the 
left, strange spots and stripes appear on the wavelength slider, the 
wave, and the screen.  If I pause the simulation and move the window 
around, there seem to be words written on the background behind the 
spots.  If I take a screen shot, the spots don’t appear on the 
screenshot.  I swear I’m not making this up."

Well, I finally figured out how to reproduce it.  It only happens if I'm 
playing a DVD.  It happens consistently when I am using Real Player, 
Windows Media Player, or WinDVD to play a DVD.  The words in the 
background behind the spots are the words on the video.  If there is a 
picture in the video, then that is what appears in the background behind 
the spots.  The same thing happens with Wave Interference if you use 
purple light.  This is probably too obscure of a bug to worry much 
about, but I figured I'd let you know what I've discovered so you can 
document it.

It seems to only happen for the particular shade of purple at the far 
left end of the wavelength slider in QWI and WI.  I was able to 
reproduce it in Lasers and Photoelectric Effect by moving the wavelength 
slider to the farthest purple.  In these simulations, a single stripe 
appears on the intensity slider (this also happens in QWI), at a 
consistent location which I think is where the color is exactly the 
shade that makes this weird thing happen.

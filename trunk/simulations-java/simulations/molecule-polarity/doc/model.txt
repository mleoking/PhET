Description of the models used in "Molecule Polarity"

********************************** 2D Model **********************************

The "Two Atoms" and "Three Atoms" tabs use a 2D model implemented by PhET.

o Electronegativity (EN) ranges internally from 2 to 4, but is never displayed to the user.
The difference in EN between 2 bonded atoms is herein referred to as "delta EN",
and varies from 0 to 2.

o Bond dipoles are parallel to the bond axis, and their length is linearly proportional
to delta EN. Note that this is a simplification; in reality, dipole is not influenced
solely by EN.

o Molecular dipole is the vector sum of the bond dipoles. In the "Two Atoms" tab,
the molecular dipole is not shown, as it is equivalent to the bond dipole.
In the "Three Atoms" tab, manipulating EN results in an understanding of summing
vector magnitudes, while manipulating bond angles results in an understanding
of summing vector angles.

o The magnitude of an atom's partial charge is linearly proportional to the absolute value
of delta EN, and we vary the size of the delta shown accordingly. A partial charge's sign
is determined by the sign of delta EN. If an atom has a higher EN than the atom at the other
end of the bond, then the partial charge's sign is negative; otherwise it is positive.
For atoms that participate in more than one bond (e.g., atom B in the "Three Atoms" tab),
net partial charge is the sum of the partial charges contributed by each bond.

o Electrostatic Potential and Electron Density are linearly proportional to delta EN.
Larger delta EN corresponds to greater difference in potential (or electron density)
and is reflected in the coloring of the surface. When delta EN is at its maximum, the
surface is colored using the full range of colors shown in the color key.  When delta
EN is zero, the entire surface is colored with the neutral color shown at the midpoint
of the color key. These surfaces are not implemented for the triatomic molecule in
the "Three Atoms" tab, because the manipulation of bond angles results in undefinable surfaces.

o When the E-Field is turned on, the molecule rotates until its molecular dipole
is in alignment with the E-Field. The speed of rotation is linearly proportional
to the magnitude of the molecular dipole. Animation is disabled while the user
is rotating the molecule or changing EN values.

********************************** 3D Model **********************************

The "Real Molecules" tab uses Jmol, an open-source Java viewer for chemical structures in 3D.
Jmol provides much of the underlying model in this tab.
More info on Jmol can be found at http://jmol.sourceforge.net.

o Molecules are described in data files that were created using Spartan chemical modeling
software. More info on Sparatan can be found at http://www.wavefun.com/products/spartan.html.
The data files are in mol2 format, and selecting a molecule loads the corresponding mol2
file into Jmol's 3D viewer, which has been integrated into the simulation play area.

o Jmol customization was accomplished using a scripting language documented at
http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/.

o We instructed Jmol to show molecules in "ball and stick" representation
using these scripting commands:

wireframe 0.1
spacefill 25%
color bonds [64,64,64]

o Jmol automatically handles all calculations for dipoles, based on partial charges in
the mol2 data files. Note that the is influenced by factors other than EN. This may result
in student confusion, and is addressed in "Tips for Teachers".
To improve visibility, we increased Jmols default dipole width using these script commands:

dipole bonds on width 0.05
dipole molecular on width 0.05

o Jmol automatically handles all visualization of isosurfaces. We use MEP (molecular electrostatic potential)
for both Electrostatic Potential and Electron Density representations, varying the color scheme
based on the representation and whether the molecule is homogeneous diatomic. For homogeneous diatomic
molecules, we instruct Jmol to render the isosurface using the same neutral colors used in our 2D model.
Jmol script commands for our surface representations are as follows:

representation / color key / homogeneous diatomic? / Jmol script
Electrostatic Potential / red-white-blue / no / isosurface VDW map MEP colorscheme "RWB" translucent
Electrostatic Potential / red-white-blue / yes / isosurface VDW color white translucent
Electrostatic Potential / rainbow / no / isosurface VDW map MEP translucent
Electrostatic Potential / rainbow / yes / isosurface VDW color [31,247,0] translucent
Electron Density / black-white / no / isosurface VDW map MEP colorscheme "BW" translucent
Electron Density / black-white / yes / isosurface VDW color [127,127,127] translucent

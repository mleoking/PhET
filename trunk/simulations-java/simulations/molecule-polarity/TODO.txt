TODO list for molecule-polarity

DESIGN
- what to show for triatomic molecule partial charges
- how should the dipoles scale?
- location of bond dipoles relative to bonds
- location of molecular dipoles relative to molecules
- better label for "Electron Density"
- decide on final set of real molecules

HIGH
- rewrite Bond Type indicator, title and labels inside, dual pointers above and below
- partial charge model and view for atom B in triatomic molecule (A-B-C), sum 2 partial charges at B, locate 180 degrees from molecular dipole
- bond dipole max length should be based on bond length, and should be slightly shorter to prevent overlap
- add minor and major ticks to EN control
- Jmol: adjust initial orientation of NH3, CH3F, CHF3, CH2F2, CHCl3
- Jmol: how to align molecular dipole with E-field?
- delete Bond.deltaElectronegativity and rewrite BondDipoleNode

MEDIUM
- add a developer control for setting play area color (piccolo-phet? see PiccoloPhetApplication)
- clean up canvas layout code in all tabs, base layout on molecule location
- canvas centering strategy
- tick marks are a little off horizontally in EN controls, changes when canvas is resized
- in Bond, we are setting partial charges of atoms to the delta EN. This works but isn't accurate, do we need a better model?

LOW
- don't like using static JmolViewerNode.RAINBOW_MEP for enabling rainbow color scheme, redesign
- add icons to control panels (dipoles, partial charge, mep,...)
- Jmol: if you change dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- Jmol: how to show partial charges independently of atom labels?
- PartialChargeNode's offset looks a little weird as molecule is rotated
- add a unity mvt, for insurance?
- simplify implementation of TwoAtomsModel.updateMoleculeOrientation
- Jmol: how to set a transparent background for the viewer?
- delete TestMepCalculation
- delete unneeded keep statements from molecule-polarity.pro

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)
- PolarImmutableVector2D
- RotateCursorHandler and associated image

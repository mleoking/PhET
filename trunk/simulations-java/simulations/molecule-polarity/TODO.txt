TODO list for molecule-polarity

HIGH
- add a "read from file" option to Molecule combo box, so that non-developers can experiment with reading files
- why doesn't MEP work for water.smol?
- how to create smol files?
- can we use smol files from http://www.chemtube3d.com/ElectrostaticSurfacesPolar.html?
- how to show partial charges with Jmol?
- how to align Jmol molecule with E-Field?
- how to create a Jmol custom isosurface for KP's electron density view?
- how to set initial orientation for Jmol viewer?
- how to change atom colors?
- why does MEP look lumpy for some molecules?
- figure out how to make all bonds and molecules translucent and move bond dipoles to centers of bonds

MEDIUM
- disable Shift-Drag feature that scales Jmol viewer
- if you change Jmol dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- startup time for "Real Molecules" is not acceptable because of Jmol, how to optimize?
- center scenegraph in the play area
- Jmol integration with Piccolo (PSwing? other options?)
- how to set a fully transparent background for Jmol viewer?
- add minor and major ticks to EN control
- hovering over an atom in Jmol viewer displays the atom's name, do we want that?

LOW

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)

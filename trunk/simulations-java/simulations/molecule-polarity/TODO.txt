TODO list for molecule-polarity

DESIGN
- requirements for "electron density" isosurface (color scheme, shape, homogeneous diatomic molecules,...)
- color scheme for "electrostatic potential" isosurface
- what is the purpose of the period table, why do we have it?
- how should the dipoles scale?
- what to show for triatomic molecule partial charges
- location of bond dipoles relative to bonds
- location of molecular dipoles relative to molecules
- location of atom labels and partial charges in "Real Molecules" tab (offset or centered? always in front, or allow occlusion?)
- should the pointer move across the full range of the Bond Type indicator?
- units for partial charge values in "Real Molecules" tab
- labels for isosurface controls
- on/off control for E-field (radio buttons vs switch graphic)
- decide on final set of real molecules
- add EN table in "Real Molecules" tab
- pick a max bond dipole length based on desired max molecular dipole length for triatomic molecule

HIGH
- change request: pause animation of E-field alignment when an EN slider is being dragged
- Jmol: adjust initial orientation of NH3, CH3F, CHF3, CH2F2, CHCl3
- Jmol: write script to get atom xyz global coordinates after rotating in Jmol viewer
- Jmol: how to align molecular dipole with E-Field?
- delete Bond.deltaElectronegativity and rewrite BondDipoleNode
- add minor and major ticks to EN control

MEDIUM
- ask NP or JB to create an image for rotation cursor, add to license.txt
- shapes and color schemes for 2D isosurfaces
- partial charge model and view for atom B in triatomic molecule (A-B-C)
- bond dipole max length should be based on bond length, and should be slightly shorter to prevent overlap
- tick marks are a little off horizontally in EN controls, changes when canvas is resized
- in Bond, we are setting partial charges of atoms to the delta EN. This works but isn't accurate, do we need a better model?
- clean up canvas layout code in all tabs, base layout on molecule location
- canvas centering strategy
- bug: bond angles can't be changed when 2D isosurface is visible

LOW
- "View" check box for Periodic Table
- custom cursor for molecule rotation
- custom cursor for bond angle manipulation
- add icons to control panels (dipoles, partial charge, mep,...)
- Jmol: add a "+" sign to positive partial change values (eg, "d=+0.42")
- Jmol: if you change dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- Jmol: how to show partial charges independently of atom labels?
- PartialChargeNode's offset looks a little weird as molecule is rotated
- add a unity mvt, for insurance?
- rewrite BondDipoleNode, it's overly complicated because it doesn't use dipole angle
- simplify implementation of TwoAtomsModel.updateMoleculeOrientation
- Jmol: how to set a transparent background for the viewer?

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)
- PolarImmutableVector2D
- RotateCursorHandler and associated image

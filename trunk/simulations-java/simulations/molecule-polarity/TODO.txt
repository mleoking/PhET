TODO list for molecule-polarity

HIGH
- specify "electron density" requirements (color, shape, what to do when no partial charges,...)
- use "isosurface VDW color white translucent" for molecules that are composed of 2 of the same atom (eg H2)

MEDIUM
- change initial molecule angle so that turning on the E-field causes it to rotate?
- add cross on dipoles
- rewrite BondDipoleNode, it's overly complicated because it doesn't use dipole angle
- simplify implementation of TwoAtomsModel.updateMoleculeOrientations
- what to do about molecules that have no partial charges? (molecules composed of 2 of the same atom)
- add icons to control panels (dipoles, partial charge, mep,...)
- find out why scenegraph doesn't take up full width in MPCanvas
- add minor and major ticks to EN control
- tick marks are a little off horizontally in EN controls, changes when canvas is resized
- redesign or eliminate Model control panel

LOW
- PartialChargeNode's offset looks a little weird as molecule is rotated
- add a unity mvt, for insurance?

Jmol
- how to iterate over atoms?
- tweak atom names in mol2 files, or figure this out programmatically?
- adjust initial orientation by editing mol2 files?
- molecules are often rendered as bonds only, no atoms visible (more often with mol2 than smol?)
- change numbering of atom labels to be per atom type
- units for partial charge? e?
- Jmol integration with Piccolo (PSwing? other options?)
- how to create smol files?
- can we use smol files from http://www.chemtube3d.com/ElectrostaticSurfacesPolar.html?
- how to show partial charges independently of atom labels?
- how to align Jmol molecule with E-Field?
- how to create a Jmol custom isosurface for "electron density" view?
- how to set initial orientation for Jmol viewer?
- move bond dipoles to centers of bonds?
- move molecule dipole to ___?
- if you change Jmol dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- how to set a transparent background for Jmol viewer?
- startup time for "Real Molecules" is not acceptable because of Jmol, how to optimize?

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)
- rotation handler, in TwoAtomMoleculeNode

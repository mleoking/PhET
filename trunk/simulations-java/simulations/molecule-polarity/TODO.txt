TODO list for molecule-polarity

DEADLINES
- Nov 7: ready for use in Susan's class

DESIGN
- better label for "Electron Density"
- Jack: concern about showing ball-and-stick representation at all times? (address by dropping Bond Type indicator)
- Jack: partial charges are sometimes very small, will students see them?
- is E-field feature necessary in "Real Molecules" tab?
- should we get rid of Bond Type indicator? (tangential, confusing in interviews, ball-and-stick concern)
- what is the final set of molecules?
- CH2F2 and CHCl3 have tiny bond dipoles, is this an issue?

HIGH
- ControlPanelNode uses PSwing, which clips check box labels on Mac, see #2447
- move Jmol console to Developer menu

MEDIUM
- play area visibly resizes at startup
- delete Bond.deltaElectronegativity and rewrite BondDipoleNode
- DipoleNode.REFERENCE_LENGTH should be a function of Di/TriatomicMolecule.BOND_LENGTH
- move duplicate code in Molecule2D subclasses into base class

LOW
- move duplicate ClockListener in 2D models to a base class
- look for Property<T> fields that shouldn't be public
- don't like using static JmolViewerNode.RAINBOW_MEP for enabling rainbow color scheme, redesign
- move RotatePoints3D someplace better

BEFORE PUBLISHING
- screenshot
- model.txt
- IntelliJ code analysis
- design doc snapshot
- implementation-notes.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)
- RotateCursorHandler and associated image
- Molecule3D.toSubscript

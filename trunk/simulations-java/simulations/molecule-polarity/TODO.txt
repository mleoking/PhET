TODO list for molecule-polarity

HIGH
- set position of partial charges
- implement TwoAtomMoleculeNode.RotationHandler
- molecular dipole vector model
- bond type (covalent/ionic) display

MEDIUM
- set visibility of module-specific controls in control panels
- add icons to control panels (dipoles, partial charge, mep,...)
- center scenegraph in the play area
- add minor and major ticks to EN control

LOW

Jmol
- switch to mol2
- isosurface VDW map MEP colorscheme "RWB" translucent
- change labels to %[atomName]
- make labels black and larger font
- investigate partial charge (partialCharge property in Jmol)
- Jmol integration with Piccolo (PSwing? other options?)
- why doesn't MEP work for water.smol?
- how to create smol files?
- can we use smol files from http://www.chemtube3d.com/ElectrostaticSurfacesPolar.html?
- how to show partial charges with Jmol?
- how to align Jmol molecule with E-Field?
- how to create a Jmol custom isosurface for KP's electron density view?
- how to set initial orientation for Jmol viewer?
- how to change atom colors?
- why does MEP look lumpy for some molecules?
- figure out how to make all bonds and molecules translucent and move bond dipoles to centers of bonds
- disable Shift-Drag feature that scales Jmol viewer
- if you change Jmol dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- how to set a fully transparent background for Jmol viewer?
- hovering over an atom in Jmol viewer displays the atom's name, do we want that?
- startup time for "Real Molecules" is not acceptable because of Jmol, how to optimize?

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)

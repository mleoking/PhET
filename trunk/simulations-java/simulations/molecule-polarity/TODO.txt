TODO list for molecule-polarity

DESIGN
- location of bond dipoles relative to bonds
- location of molecular dipoles relative to molecules
- better label for "Electron Density"
- decide on final set of real molecules
- Jack: concern about showing ball-and-stick representation at all times? (address by dropping Bond Type indicator)
- Jack: partial charges are sometimes very small, will students see them?
- is E-field feature necessary in "Real Molecules" tab?
- should we get rid of Bond Type indicator?

HIGH
- add arrows ala Bending Light (with some differences) to atoms A and C in triatomic molecule
- clean up canvas layout code in all tabs, base layout on molecule location
- ControlPanelNode uses PSwing, which clips check box labels on Mac, see #2447
- Jmol: adjust initial orientation of NH3, CH3F, CHF3, CH2F2, CHCl3

MEDIUM
- create a base class for DiatomicElectronDensityNode and DiatomicElectrostaticPotentialNode
- play area visibly resizes at startup
- delete Bond.deltaElectronegativity and rewrite BondDipoleNode
- DipoleNode.REFERENCE_LENGTH should be a function of Di/TriatomicMolecule.BOND_LENGTH
- move duplicate code in IMolecule subclasses into a base class
- locations of dipoles should be consistent between 2D and Jmol
- horizontal spacing in EN table is a little off

LOW
- move duplicate ClockListener in 2D models to a base class
- look at duplicated code between BondAngleHandler and MoleculeRotationHandler
- look for Property<T> fields that shouldn't be public
- don't like using static JmolViewerNode.RAINBOW_MEP for enabling rainbow color scheme, redesign
- simplify implementation of TwoAtomsModel.updateMoleculeOrientation
- delete TestMepCalculation
- delete unneeded keep statements from molecule-polarity.pro

BEFORE PUBLISHING
- screenshot
- model.txt
- IntelliJ code analysis
- design doc snapshot
- implementation-notes.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)
- PolarImmutableVector2D
- RotateCursorHandler and associated image
- Molecule3D.toSubscript

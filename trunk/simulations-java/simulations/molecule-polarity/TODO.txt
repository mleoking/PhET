TODO list for molecule-polarity

HIGH
- molecular dipole vector model

MEDIUM
- what to do about molecules that have no partial charges? (molecules composed of 2 of the same atom)
- set visibility of module-specific controls in control panels
- add icons to control panels (dipoles, partial charge, mep,...)
- find out why scenegraph doesn't take up full width in MPCanvas
- add minor and major ticks to EN control
- dipole magnitude should be an abs value
- tick marks are a little off horizontally in EN controls, changes when canvas is resized

LOW

Jmol
- tweak atom names in mol2 files, or figure this out programmatically?
- adjust initial orientation by editing mol2 files?
- molecules are often rendered as bonds only, no atoms visible (more often with mol2 than smol?)
- change numbering of atom labels to be per atom type
- units for partial charge? e?
- Jmol integration with Piccolo (PSwing? other options?)
- how to create smol files?
- can we use smol files from http://www.chemtube3d.com/ElectrostaticSurfacesPolar.html?
- how to show partial charges independently of atom labels?
- how to align Jmol molecule with E-Field?
- how to create a Jmol custom isosurface for "electron density" view?
- how to set initial orientation for Jmol viewer?
- move bond dipoles to centers of bonds?
- move molecule dipole to ___?
- if you change Jmol dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- how to set a transparent background for Jmol viewer?
- startup time for "Real Molecules" is not acceptable because of Jmol, how to optimize?

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)

TODO list for molecule-polarity

DESIGN
- location of bond dipoles relative to bonds
- location of molecular dipoles relative to molecules
- better label for "Electron Density"
- decide on final set of real molecules

HIGH
- implement 2D isosurface for diatomic molecule, with mep and electron density color schemes
- Jmol: how to align molecular dipole with E-field?
- convert rotate cursor to 32x32 gif, to work around Windows/Java bug #4842475
- clean up canvas layout code in all tabs, base layout on molecule location
- ControlPanelNode uses PSwing, which clips check box labels on Mac, see #2447

MEDIUM
- Jmol: adjust initial orientation of NH3, CH3F, CHF3, CH2F2, CHCl3 (wait to see whether these are cut)
- delete Bond.deltaElectronegativity and rewrite BondDipoleNode
- DipoleNode.REFERENCE_LENGTH should be a function of Di/TriatomicMolecule.BOND_LENGTH
- move duplicate code in IMolecule subclasses into a base class
- locations of dipoles should be consistent between 2D and Jmol

LOW
- move duplicate ClockListener in 2D models to a base class
- look at duplicated code between BondAngleHandler and MoleculeRotationHandler
- look for Property<T> fields that shouldn't be public
- don't like using static JmolViewerNode.RAINBOW_MEP for enabling rainbow color scheme, redesign
- Jmol: if you change dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- simplify implementation of TwoAtomsModel.updateMoleculeOrientation
- delete TestMepCalculation
- delete unneeded keep statements from molecule-polarity.pro

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)
- PolarImmutableVector2D
- RotateCursorHandler and associated image
- Molecule3D.toSubscript

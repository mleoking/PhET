TODO list for molecule-polarity

HIGH
- why doesn't electrostatic potential work for water.smol?
- how to create smol files?
- can we use smol files from http://www.chemtube3d.com/ElectrostaticSurfacesPolar.html?
- how to show partial charges with Jmol?
- how to align Jmol molecule with E-Field?
- how to create a Jmol custom isosurface for KP's electron density view

MEDIUM
- Jmol integration with Piccolo (PSwing? other options?)
- how to set a fully transparent background for Jmol viewer?
- add minor and major ticks to EN control

LOW

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)

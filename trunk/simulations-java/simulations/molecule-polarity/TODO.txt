TODO list for molecule-polarity

DESIGN
- location of bond dipoles relative to bonds
- location of molecular dipoles relative to molecules
- location of atom labels and partial charges in "Real Molecules" tab (offset or centered? always in front, or allow occlusion?)
- color scheme for "electrostatic potential" isosurface
- requirements for "electron density" isosurface (color scheme, shape, homogeneous diatomic molecules,...)
- units for partial charge values in "Real Molecules" tab
- labels for isosurface controls
- on/off control for E-field (radio buttons vs switch graphic)

HIGH
- Jmol: adjust initial orientation of NH3, CH3F, CHF3, CH2F2, CHCl3
- Jmol: write script to get atom xyz global coordinates after rotating in Jmol viewer
- refine shape of 2D isosurface
- Jmol: how to align molecular dipole with E-Field?

MEDIUM
- 3 Atoms: with A-B-C, change bond angle by dragging A or C, rotate molecule by dragging B or bonds
- 3 Atoms: place bond dipoles above, molecule dipole below, molecule dipole tail centered on B
- find out why scenegraph doesn't take up full width in MPCanvas
- add minor and major ticks to EN control
- tick marks are a little off horizontally in EN controls, changes when canvas is resized

LOW
- add icons to control panels (dipoles, partial charge, mep,...)
- Jmol: add a "+" sign to positive partial change values (eg, "d=+0.42")
- Jmol: if you change dipole properties (offset, width,...) then the viewer may clip the dipole
- Jmol: how to show partial charges independently of atom labels?
- PartialChargeNode's offset looks a little weird as molecule is rotated
- add a unity mvt, for insurance?
- rewrite BondDipoleNode, it's overly complicated because it doesn't use dipole angle
- simplify implementation of TwoAtomsModel.updateMoleculeOrientation
- Jmol: how to set a transparent background for the viewer?
- change initial molecule angle so that turning on the E-field causes it to rotate?

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HorizontalSliderDragHandler
- VerticalSliderDragHandler (from capacitor-lab, needs generalization?)
- MoleculeRotationHandler

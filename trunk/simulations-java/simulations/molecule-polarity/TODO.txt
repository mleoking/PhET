TODO list for molecule-polarity

DEADLINES
- Nov 7: ready for use in Susan's class

DESIGN
- better label for "Electron Density"
- should we get rid of Bond Type indicator? (tangential, confusing in interviews, see Jack's ball-and-stick concern)
- Jack: concern about showing ball-and-stick representation at all times? (address by dropping Bond Type indicator?)
- Jack: partial charges are sometimes very small, will students see them?
- is E-field feature necessary in "Real Molecules" tab?
- CH2F2 and CHCl3 have tiny bond dipoles
- final set of molecules
- layout change in "Real Molecules" to allow making Jmol viewer bigger
- larger font for controls

MEDIUM
- delete Bond.deltaElectronegativity, rewrite setComponentX and translate steps in BondDipoleNode
- rewrite DipoleNode and its subclasses

LOW
- play area visibly resizes at startup

BEFORE PUBLISHING
- screenshot
- model.txt
- IntelliJ code analysis
- design doc snapshot

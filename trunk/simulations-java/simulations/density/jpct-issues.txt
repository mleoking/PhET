I asked for permission to use proguard to shrink jpct.jar in this thread:
http://www.jpct.net/forum2/index.php/topic,1201.0.html

    Could I also have permission to use Proguard's shrinking feature on jpct.jar?  It's an essential part of our toolchain, and we need to minimize the size of our resulting jars.  I know others have reported some problems with using this (see above), but I didn't want to try without permission.

    Thanks,
    Sam Reid

    The license allow you to obfuscate/repack the jar...so feel free to do so.

It's somewhat disturbing that jPCT is using package name com.threed.jpct.
The domain threed.com does not appear to be registered to them.

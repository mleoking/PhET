Forces in potential tab

- add vanderwalls and coulomb (attractive and repulsive) forces as option

- 3 options as radio buttons:
	>Show separate forces
	>Show total force
	>Show none

- make adjustments grabbable on graph, with some indicator that you can grab them. Look at other sims for this.

- make adjustment sliders appear only  when "Adjustable Attraction" is selected

- add thumbtack to pin down left atom

- remove "Stop Atom" button

- add "Return Atom" box for when atom disappears off of the screen

- change reset to "Reset All"

- add little icons for molecules (just little blue, green, or violet spheres)

- ???

From Trish 9/4/08

     First tab: One thing I thought would be interesting was to change the state to liquid and toggle between the substances. I realized that when I change substance the phase goes back to solid, but there is no indicator. When you select a phase, the button is outlined but not if you change substance.

    Second Tab: I miss having a particle counter and also get tired of pumping. It seems like a control like there is in the other chemistry sims would be helpful (Gas Properties, Salt, and Reactions all have particle number controls and counters). Also, I would like to repeat my thought that the Gravity control should be demoted to below the other diagrams.

>>>NP: Particle counter seems like a good idea.
	 Need to have a look at gravity slider.

   Third tab: I like the new sizes. I am not sure how the STOP ATOM button is supposed to work, why wouldn't a user just press PAUSE? Right now, it seems that once I hit it I cannot get the ball to move again unless I drag it.

>>> NP: We decided to remove the Stop Atom button.

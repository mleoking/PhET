# 1.20.36 (29139) Mar 2, 2009
Removed bounding box from graphics
Workaround for faded out buttons in time control panel

# 1.20.35 (28935) Feb 22, 2009
Fixed: when you drive the bug with the remote using velocity or acceleration, the bug does not face the direction of velocity (always faces the same direction)
Fixed: Rewind button should be disabled when the timeline knob is at t=0
Fixed: Slowest mode should be slower (maybe 1/2 this speed)
Fixed: Switching from playback mode to record should clear the vectors on the bug
Fixed: Clear button should put the sim in record mode if it was in playback mode
Reduced speed of all preset motions by 30%
Fixed: Exception when switching back and forth between record and playback
Fixed: Recording should stop when timeline is full. "Record" label should go from red to black when it stops recording. You can still move the bug, but it does not record any more. (In order to record more, you need to hit clear.)
Fixed: the trace should stop when it stops recording, since the trace and timeline are coupled

# 1.20.33 (28801) Feb 19, 2009
Batch deploy for alpha Simulation Tests, svn 28773
# 1.20.32 (28726) Feb 18, 2009

# 1.20.30 (28721) Feb 18, 2009
Improvements for Aphid Maze
Fixed: open sim click frictionless click circular. Bug will not move.

# 1.20.29 (28260) Feb 8, 2009
Bugfixes for remote control
Ladybug comes to rest when turning friction on
Increased size of return ladybug button
Click-Drag from the center dot in Remote Control creates a vector
Fixed: Manually moving the ladybug out of the frame, then clicking on return ladybug causes her to run offscreen again; her motion and position should be cleared on reset.
Improved layout of time control panel
Sim pauses when selecting playback mode, rather than automatically playing when you click the radio button.

# 1.20.28 (28207) Feb 6, 2009
Fixed: Remote control arrow node captures mouse input
Fixed: Switching to manual mode doesn't work after timeline is full.
Fixed: remote control does not work if you click inside of the arrow (you have to click outside of the arrow, or very near the tip it seems).
Fixed: "Throwable" box should be labeled "Frictionless".
Fixed: Reset All does not return "Throwable" to default (off) state.
Fixed: "Throwable" checkbox should be moved to right above remote control.
Fixed: "Reset All" should be centered in the bottom of control panel.
Fixed: Changed "Recording" to "Record" in mode indicator

# 1.20.27 (28186) Feb 5, 2009
Rewind works when in playback mode.
If you select "Playback" radio button it rewinds and puts you in playback mode.
Fixed: If you move the bug and then hit "reset all", when you move the bug again it goes to its start position, but jumps
Put the remote and the controls for remote on a raised section of control panel, so that it is clear that these controls go with remote, and to separate it (somewhat) from other controls.
Trace label and controls moved left to align with other controls in control panel.
Removed clear button by trace
Added clear button by recording controls
Blue timeline color matches the trace color
Timeline blue line thinner so that it looks more like "inside" the timeline
When you hit "clear" button for trace, recording should not begin until you move the bug (like start up state). Bug will stay in last position, and clear the trace and recording, but not begin recording until bug is moved.
Removed checkbox for "Hide mouse during drag"
Added the label "Vectors" above the controls for showing/hiding vectors.
Added radio buttons in the play controls box for "Recording" and "Playback" modes. These will double as indicators of the current mode.
Rewind button is always grayed out in record mode
If you switch to record mode (from playback) it erases the remainder of the timeline after thumb position and starts recording from where the thumb was.
Decreased sensitivity of remote control
Added throwable checkbox to the control panel; allows "frictionless" manual mode

# 1.20.26 (28105) Feb 5, 2009
Added fade feature on dot trace
Removed invisible and solid line traces
Improve thumb handle on timeline
Improve graphics for timeline track
Timeline doesn't disappear during record

# 1.20.25 (28043) Feb 03 2009
Added fudge factors to improve velocity and acceleration scales
Inverted Y Axis so that positive Y is up
Major performance improvements
Should show acceleration and velocity while moving to circle.
Should have smooth transition between linear and circular motion modes.

# 1.20.24 (27822) 01-31-2009
Fixed: Remote control doesn't show correct initial position
Fixed: When switching to manual from a premade motion, don't jump to old last recorded position.
Fixed: Return ladybug is broken
Added fade trace option, works during record and playback
Set fade path to default
Fixed remote control to use new position mode sampling
Added partial fade path
Added faint blue background for timeline

# 1.20.23 (27797) 01-30-2009
Changed to Motion2D model
Put black outlines on the vel and acc vectors to help them stand out
Reduce speed of preset motions

# 1.20.22 (27694) 01-26-2009
# 1.20.21 (27692) 01-26-2009
Added developer controls for motion behavior
Added cursor to playback speed slider

# 1.20.20 (27683) 01-26-2009
Use analytic values for velocity and acceleration in circular motion
Use analytic values for velocity and acceleration in ellipse

# 1.20.19 (27680) 01-26-2009
Changed default recording time from 30 to 15 seconds
Removed the "Stop/Go" button below the remote control
Added playback speed slider
Compute velocity and acceleration as averages over 6 data points with slope of linear fit (as in rotation sim)
Start the ladybug somewhere other than (0,0) so that the Remote Control position vector will be visible on startup
Added return ladybug button
Bigger circle in middle of remote control. Clicking anywhere on this circle sets vel or acc exactly to zero.
Sim starts paused; starts recording when bug is moved
Show acceleration and velocity even before 20 history points have been recorded
The sim should be running on startup but not recording until the user moves the bug, uses the remote control or chooses a preset motion.
Renamed "clear trace" to "clear" and made it clear history instead of just the graphical trace.
The Ladybug should be smaller - more similar to size of bugs in Rotation.
Fixed: - Vectors in remote are not sized to the same relative proportions as they are on the bug. For example, accel vector is very small on bug, very large in remote.
Set circular motion speed so that dots match up exactly in trace
Set elliptical motion speed so that dots match up exactly in trace
Fixed: In linear mode, bug bounces off the walls at the wrong angles. Should bounce off at the same angle of incidence. That is, if it hits at 30 deg from perpendicular, it should bounce off at 30 deg from perpendicular in the other direction.
Only record once bug is moved. So once out of playback mode, do not record until bug is grabbed. Regardless of how we handle the functionality of buttons.
Centered coordinate frame, and added dynamic model bounds
Fixed: (0,0) should be the middle of the screen instead of the middle of the box that fits on the left portion of the screen
Fixed: Bug sometimes changes direction in the middle of the play area for no apparent reason.
Improved clock control panel layout
Fixed: Don't allow "Rewind" when there is no stored data.

# 1.20.18 (27515) 01-21-2009
Changed velocity color to green
Changed acceleration color to pink
Changed position to blue
Changed line trace to have same color as position
Added a dot to the center of the Remote Control
Made ladybug arrow vectors 1/4 as wide
Removed clock from RecordingControl
Fixed trace to only show last 30 seconds
Increased play area acceleration vector length (by factor of 1.2)
Decreased play area velocity vector length (multiplied by 0.55)
Disabled motions during playback
(add developer control for investigation) Should be able to set a value to the Remote Control, and have it remain even after releasing mouse button.
(add dev control) Remote Control should act as an indicator as well as controller
Added dev control for timeline length
Added developer controls to simulate options for returning to record mode
Improved performance during record, motion is much smoother
Made aspect ratio square

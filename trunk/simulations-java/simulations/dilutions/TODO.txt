TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- sliders are accurate to 3 decimal places but we're only showing 2, so we see "0" and "0.00"
- 1/2L vs 0.5L for beaker tick?
- various issues with black text on dark background colors

HIGH
- frosty translucent background behind formula on beaker
- translucent background behind "Saturated!"

MEDIUM
- up/down arrows in slider JTextField to increment/decrement

LOW
- repackage

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat

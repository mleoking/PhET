TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- color for water
- color scale issues in Molarity tab

HIGH
- distribute precipitate on bottom of 3D beaker (random distribution of points inside an ellipse, see ABS MoleculeNode.getRandomPoint)
- improve look of sliders

MEDIUM
- Tab2: Use beakers (as shown in mock up), layout similar to mock up shown except move the volume control for the small V1 beaker to be next to
the beaker (similar to volume controls for the other beakers, so that the slider corresponds with solution level).
- Tab2: These beakers can have hash marks showing half, 1/4, 3/4 full, but no numerical values.
- Tab2: Omit the plus sign. Keep the equals sign.
- Tab2: Make the concentration range for M1 and M2 both be the full range. See how this works out. Since M2 is a read out, we shouldn't run into trouble.

LOW
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)
- delete code related to "Show values" feature, if we decide it's gone for good (start with MolarityModule.SHOW_VALUE_FEATURE_ENABLED)
- repackage

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat

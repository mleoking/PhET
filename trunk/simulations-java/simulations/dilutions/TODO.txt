TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- color for water
- color scale issues in Molarity tab
- layout problem in Dilution tab, too much stuff in horizontal dimension (move min/max labels to control ends? use tall skinny beakers?)
- Dilution tab: include a few other color options for solution "in Teacher menu"?
- Dilution tab: layout is (left-to-right) M1*V1 = V2*M2, which is not M1*V1=M2*V2

HIGH
- M1 control in Dilution tab
- curved tick marks on beakers (Arc2D)

MEDIUM

LOW
- i18n: beakers and their labels do not resize to accommodate longer text
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat
- NamedPoints

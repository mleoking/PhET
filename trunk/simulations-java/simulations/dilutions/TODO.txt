TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- Tab 3 (Making Dilutions)
- Dilution: do we really want all 3 beakers labeled "H2O" when concentrations are zero?
- default values in all tabs

HIGH
- bug: in Dilutions tab, initial volume of H2O beaker is off by 1 tick on some platforms
- multi-color gradients for solutes, specifically for Kool-Aid and KMnO4 (as in design doc beaker photos)

MEDIUM

LOW
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat
- NamedPoints

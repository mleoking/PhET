TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- overly verbose titles for sliders and concentration display
- sliders are accurate to 3 decimal places but we're only showing 2, so we see "0" and "0.00"
- better looking sliders

HIGH
- adjust gradients on concentration display to account for saturation point
- add tick marks for min/max range labels on sliders and concentration display
- make labels less verbose on sliders and concentration display
- add tick marks to beaker, labeled?
- grab beaker from ph-scale

MEDIUM
- relative layout of Molarity tab

LOW
- repackage

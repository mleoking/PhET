TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- Tab 3 (Making Dilutions)

HIGH
- Dilution: M1 control, no need to gray out part of track as in mockup
- Dilution: implementation of M1*V1=M2*V2
- Molarity: more convincing gradients for Kool-Aid and KMnO4, as in design doc beaker photos

MEDIUM

LOW
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat
- NamedPoints

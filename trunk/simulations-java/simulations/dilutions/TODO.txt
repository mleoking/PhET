TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- color for water
- color scale issues in Molarity tab
- Dilution: should V1 go to zero? What happens to M1 when this happens?

HIGH
- Dilution: M1 control
- Dilution: tall skinny beakers (3:1), labels above

MEDIUM

LOW
- i18n: beakers and their labels do not resize to accommodate longer text
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat
- NamedPoints

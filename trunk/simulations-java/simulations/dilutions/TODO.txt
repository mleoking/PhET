TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- color for water
- color scale issues in Molarity tab
- if solute amount is "none", concentration should be zero, not "low"
- layout problem in Dilution tab, too much stuff in horizontal dimension (move min/max labels to control ends? use tall skinny beakers?)

HIGH
- create a beaker base class that can be statically labeled and involves no observers
- Dilution tab
- curved tick marks on beakers (Arc2D)

MEDIUM
- Tab2: Use beakers (as shown in mock up), layout similar to mock up shown except move the volume control for the small V1 beaker to be next to
the beaker (similar to volume controls for the other beakers, so that the slider corresponds with solution level).
- Tab2: These beakers can have hash marks showing half, 1/4, 3/4 full, but no numerical values.
- Tab2: Omit the plus sign. Keep the equals sign.
- Tab2: Make the concentration range for M1 and M2 both be the full range. See how this works out. Since M2 is a read out, we shouldn't run into trouble.

LOW
- improve look of sliders
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat
- NamedPoints

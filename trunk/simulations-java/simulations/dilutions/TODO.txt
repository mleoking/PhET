TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- Tab 3 (Making Dilutions)
- default values in all tabs

HIGH
- move Molarity sim to a new project?
- restore "Show values" feature (deleted in [57987] and [58016])
- show min/max/current value on sliders, with editable current value

MEDIUM
- generalize the mechanism for managing dynamic beaker labels

LOW
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat (or delete if this sim remains qualitative)

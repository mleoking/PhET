TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- move min/max range labels to tick marks next to sliders and concentration display
- model for precipitate in Molarity tab
- overly verbose titles for sliders and concentration display
- sliders are accurate to 3 decimal places but we're only showing 2, so we see "0" and "0.00"

HIGH
- fix bug with slider thumb, not centered, hard to grab when it's released at max
- add beaker
- editable text fields above sliders
- show/hide values

MEDIUM
- relative layout of Molarity tab
- better colors and shape for slider thumb

LOW
- repackage

MIGRATE TO COMMON

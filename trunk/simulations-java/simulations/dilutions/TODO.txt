TODO list for dilutions

DESIGN
- color for water
- color scale issues in Molarity tab
- layout problem in Dilution tab, too much stuff in horizontal dimension (move min/max labels to control ends? use tall skinny beakers?)

HIGH
- create a beaker base class that can be statically labeled and involves no observers
- M1 control in Dilution tab
- curved tick marks on beakers (Arc2D)

MEDIUM

LOW
- i18n: beakers and their labels do not resize to accommodate longer text
- improve look of sliders
- use PrecisionDecimal in the model, 2 decimal places (if we're showing values)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SmartDoubleFormat
- NamedPoints

Model description of Molarity simulation

The basic equation for Molarity is:

  M = mol/L

A chemical solution is a solute dissolved in a solvent.
The solvent in this sim is pure water.
The solutes are shown in the combo box, and each has an associated saturated concentration.
Adding solute beyond the saturated concentration results in formation of a precipitate.

Concentration of a solution is:

   M = min( (saturatedConcentration (M), ( (amountOfSolute (moles)) / (volumeOfSolution (L)) )

When a solution is saturated, the amount of precipiate is:

   precipitate (moles) = ( (amountOfSolute (moles)) / (volumeOfSolution(L)) ) - (saturatedConcentration (M))

The number of precipitate particles shown in the beaker is:

   numberOfParticles = (precipitate (moles)) * particlesPerMole

where particlesPerMole is specified for each solute.

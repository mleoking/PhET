Charts:

Add clipping for Buffered strategies in DynamicJFreeChartNode

Add a graph cursor.

When resizing a graph, the layout can change (due to difference in axis labels), so realignment should be done after any data area changes.

Move charts to jfreechart-phet directory?

When the time series is off-scale, dragging the slider doesn't immediately respond.
Clicking on the slider thumb should set the current value, and allow immediate drags.

Chart strokes are different for dynamic paint and static repaint.

Should TimeSeriesModel be extended or listened to for Rotation-specific behaivor?

Test at 1024x768

On rotational motion sim, lots of it worked well and looked good, but when showing acceleration a,
the zero and the curve was below bottom of graph sometime. Angular acceleration  worked well though.

Performance optimization.

Time series implementation.

Time derivatives need a time-offset to match other series.

Time series are offset incorrectly in graphs (their x-offset is before the beginning of the graph).

Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data..?

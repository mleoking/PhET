Added initial support for ruler
Added white dot in the middle of bug to represent center of motion
Fixed: Angular velocity graph should go from -0.15 to 0.15
Fixed: Bugs are not grabbable when out of the play area
Fixed: Wheel should be proportionately bigger on high resolution.
Fixed: Symbol key should be a button that pops up a dialog
Fixed: Graphs should accurately show time axis values
Fixed: Time axis should be longer (take longer to fill a chart)
    -changed from 15 seconds to 30 seconds
Ladybug is initialized on the rotation platform
Fixed: Ladybug should not be able to be taken off the wheel.
Fixed: Less tick marks on vertical axis
Fixed: Rotation platform colors should alternate (same on diagonal)
Fixed: Rotation platform colors should be muted, attention should be on the bug.
Added: a vertical axis label on these graphs as in force 1 D.
Fixed: No graphs or values should be shown for platform
Removed "Go/Pause" and "Clear" buttons for non-editable graphs
Performance improvements
Fixed: Character Angle should be user settable via the graph
Fixed: Synchronize ruler coordinates with play area
Fixed: Full vertical titles go off the page in 1024x768 at default font
Fixed: Vector arrow labels are no longer centered (bug introduced when adding model coordinates)

0.00.17
Added improved initial locations for characters.

0.00.16 (7-9-2007)
Added exact motion model for specified angular acceleration. 

0.00.14 (7-3-2007)
Added a second character.
Bugfix: invisible velocity and acceleration arrows obscure mouse events

0.00.13 (6-29-2007)
Improvements from motion subproject
    -improved handling for time series
    -corrected physics for offset derivatives
    -improved playback/record control panel
Added multiple series for acceleration, velocity (x,y, and magnitude)

0.00.12
Fixed: Chart arrows not updating during playback.

0.00.11 (5-23-2007)
Added a graph cursor to show during playback.
Fixed: Graph cursor should appear at the correct time when simulation is paused.
Fixed: Graph cursor should set playback time during dragging.
Fixed: Graph Cursor shouldn't be draggable beyond the end of available data.
Fixed: Graph Cursor doesn't move on "rewind"
Fixed: data doesn't render correctly after change of buffer

0.00.10 (5-16-2007)
Add clipping for Buffered strategies in DynamicJFreeChartNode
Fixed: When repainting a chart, there can be a pixel or 2 offset that looks incorrect.  i.e. BufferedSeriesView.paintAll differs from incremental paint
Chart cursor node: updates are change driven (not every time step)
Added scaling for play area to handle different resolutions
Fixed: Data generating model should not change when zooming in or out of a graph.

0.00.07
Fixed: Angle graphs should wrap around instead of being modulo 2*Pi.

0.00.06
Fixed: Graphs shouldn't fill entire vertical space when there is only 1.

0.00.05
Added alignment for graphs.

0.00.03 (12-29-2006)
Added tests for some components (see Test menu).

0.00.02 (12-28-2006)
Added version info.

0.00.01 (12-27-2006)
Started rotation project.

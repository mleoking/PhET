0.00.40

0.00.35 (7-18-2007)
Added alternative rendering strategy for experimentation
Added condition to avoid the expense of circular regression if possible

0.00.31 (7-18-2007)
Added units to in-graph readouts
Calibrated time scale slider
“Show symbol key” button switches to “Hide symbol key” if symbol key is showing.
On Position, V and A graphs, removed "X" from title label.
Changed the checkboxes to read e.g. “Show X-position” instead of just "X-Position"
Switched from 3 subtick marks on ruler to 4 so they would be at 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8
Added "Reset All" button
Improved layout for in-graph readouts for one and two-character cases
Bugfixes

Fixed: After putting beetle on the rotation platform, then clear, then manually move ladybug, acceleration is shown with velocity vector during playback.
Fixed: time series not for rotation body not cleared properly

0.00.30 (7-16-2007)
Added initial support for ruler
Added white dot in the middle of bug to represent center of motion
Fixed: Angular velocity graph should go from -0.15 to 0.15
Fixed: Bugs are not grabbable when out of the play area
Fixed: Wheel should be proportionately bigger on high resolution.
Fixed: Symbol key should be a button that pops up a dialog
Fixed: Graphs should accurately show time axis values
Fixed: Time axis should be longer (take longer to fill a chart)
    -changed from 15 seconds to 30 seconds
Ladybug is initialized on the rotation platform
Fixed: Ladybug should not be able to be taken off the wheel.
Fixed: Less tick marks on vertical axis
Fixed: Rotation platform colors should alternate (same on diagonal)
Fixed: Rotation platform colors should be muted, attention should be on the bug.
Added: a vertical axis label on these graphs as in force 1 D.
Fixed: No graphs or values should be shown for platform
Removed "Go/Pause" and "Clear" buttons for non-editable graphs
Performance improvements
Fixed: Character Angle should be user settable via the graph
Fixed: Synchronize ruler coordinates with play area
Fixed: Full vertical titles go off the page in 1024x768 at default font
Fixed: Vector arrow labels are no longer centered (bug introduced when adding model coordinates)
Added: checkboxes for selecting series data on multi-series charts
Fixed: Velocity(x) should be written X-Velocity, get rid of (vx) on charts
Fixed: Stroke phase changes on refresh
Fixed: Space should be reserved in the play area for the origin node.
Fixed: Zoom change doesn't repaint graphs
Added: support for graphs with no series, to improve interface to adding multiple series
Fixed: Web version has centripetal acceleration arrow missing the center on user drag
Fixed: When Second Bug is added to the platform, charts should show series data for it.
Fixed: Check boxes (like in Force1D) for adding/removing series (applies to both characters)
    -Only show one checkbox for both characters, and have it apply to both characters; 
Fixed: Second Bug’s data series should be dotted lines
Fixed: Checkbox to remove/add second bug's dashed line data in graph. Bug itself should remain visible.
Fixed: During playback, sometimes off-platform character spins in place (looks like on-platform vs. off-platform state is not being recorded and restored properly)
    -character orientation is now saved and restored
Removed: text boxes on the left side of graphs for uneditable series
Fixed: Symbol key takes a long time before initial paint, appears gray.
Fixed: For X,V,A graphs (or noneditable series in general), readouts should be on-graph, no text-boxes on left hand side

0.00.17
Added improved initial locations for characters.

0.00.16 (7-9-2007)
Added exact motion model for specified angular acceleration. 

0.00.14 (7-3-2007)
Added a second character.
Bugfix: invisible velocity and acceleration arrows obscure mouse events

0.00.13 (6-29-2007)
Improvements from motion subproject
    -improved handling for time series
    -corrected physics for offset derivatives
    -improved playback/record control panel

0.00.12
Fixed: Chart arrows not updating during playback.

0.00.11 (5-23-2007)

Fixed: Graph cursor should set playback time during dragging.
Fixed: Graph Cursor shouldn't be draggable beyond the end of available data.
Fixed: Graph Cursor doesn't move on "rewind"
Fixed: data doesn't render correctly after change of buffer

0.00.10 (5-16-2007)
Add clipping for Buffered strategies in DynamicJFreeChartNode
Fixed: When repainting a chart, there can be a pixel or 2 offset that looks incorrect.  i.e. BufferedSeriesView.paintAll differs from incremental paint
Chart cursor node: updates are change driven (not every time step)
Added scaling for play area to handle different resolutions
Fixed: Data generating model should not change when zooming in or out of a graph.

0.00.07

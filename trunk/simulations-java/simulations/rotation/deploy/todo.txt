#For Motion/TimeSeries libraries

Maybe Views of recorded data should observe a Recorded Data Model from time series package.

Bug: Timers for model & recording structures got out of sync.

Time derivatives need a time-offset to match other series.

When the time series is off-scale, dragging the slider doesn't immediately respond.
    -Clicking on the slider thumb should set the current value, and allow immediate drags.

When resizing a graph, the layout can change (due to difference in axis labels), so realignment should be done after any data area changes.

Performance optimization.
    -Should cursors nodes use paint-immediately instead of creating a large repaint rectangle?  Or a different implementation for RepaintManager?
    -Repaint rectangles are large during normal operation, due to moving arrows (could be in separate repaint region?)

#For Rotation

Consolidate MovingMan, Forces1D, Ramp, Rotation, Torque into a single codebase.

Should be able to "spin" the wheel (i.e. drag, let go, and have it continue to spin, at least in friction mode)

Do we want to calculate the angular velocity of bug if user is manually moving it around?
    No.  Just don’t update it when user is manipulating bug.

Graphs for Angular Velocity and Angular Position should be attached to the object (not the rotational platform)?

Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data..?

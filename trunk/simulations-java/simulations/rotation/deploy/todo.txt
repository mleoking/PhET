#     To Do
################

•   Bug Angle should be user settable via the graph
•   Synchronize ruler coordinates with play area
•	Use colors from the color chart
•	Check boxes (like in Force1D) for adding/removing series (applies to both characters)
•	For X,V,A graphs, readouts should be on-graph, no text-boxes on left hand side
•	Velocity(x) should be written X-Velocity, get rid of (vx) on charts
•	When Second Bug is added to the platform, charts should show series data for it.
•	Second Bug’s data series should be dotted lines
•	Checkbox to remove/add second bug. (Just remove/add dashed line in graph, not hide/show bug itself)
•   Bug: Mouse gets disassociated from ladybug character after trying to drag out of bounds.
•	Improve performance
•	Shadow projections should be considered after AAPT.
•	Possible interview question: bug icon at tip of graph to improve conceptual connection
•	Bug: sun.dc.pr.PRException: endPath: bad path
•	RotationBody should have internal representation for angular velocity and angular acceleration instead of relying on RotationPlatform's instance?
•	Torque mode: Should be able to "spin" the wheel (i.e. drag, let go, and have it continue to spin, at least in friction mode)
•	Minor UI fixes
•	Minor bugfixes
•	Side view/projections?
•	Consolidate MovingMan, Forces1D, Ramp, Rotation, Torque into a single codebase.

•	Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data..?

#     To Do
################################
              
•	Bug: On test laptop, Java 1.5, during user interaction with the platform, clock is not able to tick
•	Bug: Beetle graph appears empty before beetle is on the platform
•   Bug: Transparency is not being used correctly on Mac.
•	Invert coordinate frame so that +x and +y are in 1st quadrant
•	Improve performance
•   On graph readouts should have a better (fixed) layout.

Lower Priority:
•   Bug: Mouse gets disassociated from ladybug character after trying to drag out of bounds.
•	Shadow projections should be considered after AAPT.
•	Possible interview question: bug icon at tip of graph to improve conceptual connection
•	Torque mode: Should be able to "spin" the wheel (i.e. drag, let go, and have it continue to spin, at least in friction mode)
•	Consolidate MovingMan, Forces1D, Ramp, Rotation, Torque into a single codebase.
•	Symbol key should appear near the mouse when "show symbol key" pressed

#           Implementation issues
################################
•	Factor MotionBodyState and MotionBodySeries into a single object
•	Implementation for setting platform angle by setting character angle is fragile
•	RotationBody should have internal representation for angular velocity and angular acceleration instead of relying on RotationPlatform's instance?

################################################
#           Questions:
################################
•	Got rid of abbreviations like (vx) on charts, do we want to show abbreviations (e.g. symbol for theta) for other series?
•	Use colors from the color chart: how to handle components and multiple bodies?
    -Current implementation uses:
        o vector magnitude for 1st character = color from Moving Man
        o x and y components are other main colors (red, green, blue)
        o second body is same as above but darker
•   Time should stop at the end of available graphing space (if any graphs maximized)?  What did we do in Moving Man, Energy Skate Park, etc?
•	Support for "missing values" in the series data (for when characters are being dragged by the user and don't have values for angular data series)
    -Current implementation linearly interpolates between previous and subsequent values
    -It would be fairly difficult to add a "missing value" feature

################################################
#           Postponed:
################################
•	Investigate acceleration model from Motion2D simulation as a possibility for replacing the implementation in rotation.

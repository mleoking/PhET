#     To Do
################

•	Bug: Zoom change doesn't repaint graphs, should use dynamicjfreechartnode.forceupdate
•	Add support for graphs with no series, so all 'addseries' methods can be consolidated
•	Space should be reserved in the play area for the origin node.
•	Use colors from the color chart
•	For X,V,A graphs, readouts should be on-graph, no text-boxes on left hand side
•	When Second Bug is added to the platform, charts should show series data for it.
•	Second Bug’s data series should be dotted lines
•	Checkbox to remove/add second bug. (Just remove/add dashed line in graph, not hide/show bug itself)
•	Check boxes (like in Force1D) for adding/removing series (applies to both characters)
•   Bug: Mouse gets disassociated from ladybug character after trying to drag out of bounds.
•	Improve performance
•	Support for "missing values" in the series data (for when characters are being dragged by the user and don't have values for angular data series)
•	Factor MotionBodyState and MotionBodySeries into a single object
•	Implementation for setting platform angle by setting character angle is fragile 
•	Shadow projections should be considered after AAPT.
•	Possible interview question: bug icon at tip of graph to improve conceptual connection
•	Bug: sun.dc.pr.PRException: endPath: bad path
•	RotationBody should have internal representation for angular velocity and angular acceleration instead of relying on RotationPlatform's instance?
•	Torque mode: Should be able to "spin" the wheel (i.e. drag, let go, and have it continue to spin, at least in friction mode)
•	Consolidate MovingMan, Forces1D, Ramp, Rotation, Torque into a single codebase.
•	Symbol key should appear near the mouse when "show symbol key" pressed

#           Questions:

•	Got rid of abbreviations like (vx) on charts, do we want to show abbreviations for other series?

•	Investigate acceleration model from Motion2D simulation as a possibility for replacing the implementation in rotation.

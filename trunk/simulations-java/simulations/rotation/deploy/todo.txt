#     To Do
################

Rotation
•   Synchronize ruler coordinates with play area
•	Improve performance
•	Use colors from the color chart (from Wendy)
•	Check boxes (like in Force1D) for adding/removing series (applies to both characters)
•	For X,V,A graphs, readouts should be on-graph, no text-boxes on left hand side
•	Velocity(x) should be written X-Velocity, get rid of (vx) on charts
•	When Second Bug is added to the platform, charts should show series data for it.
•	Second Bug’s data series should be dotted lines
•	Checkbox to remove/add second bug. (Just remove/add dashed line in graph, not hide/show bug itself)
•   Bug: Mouse gets disassociated from ladybug character after trying to drag out of bounds.
•	Shadow projections should be considered after AAPT.
•	Possible interview question: bug icon at tip of graph to improve conceptual connection
•	Bug: sun.dc.pr.PRException: endPath: bad path
•	RotationBody should have internal representation for angular velocity and angular acceleration instead of relying on RotationPlatform's instance?

Should be able to "spin" the wheel (i.e. drag, let go, and have it continue to spin, at least in friction mode)

Do we want to calculate the angular velocity of bug if user is manually moving it around?
    No.  Just don’t update it when user is manipulating bug.

Graphs for Angular Velocity and Angular Position should be attached to the object (not the rotational platform)?

In one run, character positions weren't updated during playback.

o	Minor UI fixes
o	Minor bugfixes
o	Handling multiple objects on a single graph
o	Handling multiple series on a single graph
o	Side view/projections?

Getting the correct colors for each object/variable

How about putting a small icon for the character at the tip of the series data as a way to differentiate?

Rotation platform should be centered or expanded at high resolution

Consolidate MovingMan, Forces1D, Ramp, Rotation, Torque into a single codebase.

Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data..?

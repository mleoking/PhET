Should be able to "spin" the wheel (i.e. drag, let go, and have it continue to spin, at least in friction mode)

Do we want to calculate the angular velocity of bug if user is manually moving it around?
    No.  Just don’t update it when user is manipulating bug.

Graphs for Angular Velocity and Angular Position should be attached to the object (not the rotational platform)?

In one run, character positions weren't updated during playback.

o	Minor UI fixes
o	Minor bugfixes
o	Handling multiple objects on a single graph
o	Handling multiple series on a single graph
o	Side view/projections?

Getting the correct colors for each object/variable

How about putting a small icon for the character at the tip of the series data as a way to differentiate?

Rotation platform should be centered or expanded at high resolution

Consolidate MovingMan, Forces1D, Ramp, Rotation, Torque into a single codebase.

Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data..?

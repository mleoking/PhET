Should be able to "spin" the wheel (i.e. drag, let go, and have it continue to spin, at least in friction mode) 

Chart arrows not updating during playback.

Perhaps time series implementation should be an observer of "recordable model" not driving it.

Maybe Views of recorded data should observe a Recorded Data Model from time series.

Bug: Timers for model & recording structures got out of sync.

Graphs for Angular Velocity and Angular Position should be attached to the object (not the rotational platform)?

Move charts, cursor, etc to jfreechart-phet directory?

Performance optimization.
    -Should cursors nodes use paint-immediately instead of creating a large repaint rectangle?

Time derivatives need a time-offset to match other series.

When the time series is off-scale, dragging the slider doesn't immediately respond.
Clicking on the slider thumb should set the current value, and allow immediate drags.

When resizing a graph, the layout can change (due to difference in axis labels), so realignment should be done after any data area changes.

Consolidate MovingMan, Forces1D, Ramp, Rotation, Torque into a single codebase.

Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data..?

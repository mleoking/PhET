Made salt crystals square instead of round
Fixed: If you empty the solution, the bar charts go off-scale and stay that way when you add more water
Fixed: input faucet flows past the base of the beaker
Fixed water color for faucets
Added reset for water level, solute molarities, faucet flow levels and existence of crystals in the air
Moved the reset all button to the bottom right
Made it so the "remove solutes" button only appears if there are any solutes
Made water a lighter blue
Made the bar chart background the same color as the water
Made sugar and salt bars white in the concentration bar chart
Set the faucet flow back to zero when the user lets go, the user has to hold the slider to keep the faucet on
Moved salt bar to the left of sugar bar in concentration bar chart
Added water coming out of the faucets
# 0.00.03 (51620) May 6, 2011

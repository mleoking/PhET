Fixed: precipitate dissolves when draining liquid
# 0.00.11 (52005) May 16, 2011
Added saturation and precipitation
Refactored sugar and salt shakers to share the same code
Changed grain amounts to 0.05 mol for salt and 0.01 mol for sugar
Fixed: If you only put a little water (less than the height of the lower pipe) crystals fall past without getting absorbed
# 0.00.10 (51984) May 16, 2011
Fixed: if you press "reset all" when the tester is in the play area, it disappears from the sim
Made it so you can drag the battery to move the conductivity tester
Fixed: if you let go once the electrode is fully immersed, you can't drag it back up (except if you move the bulb)
Made the sugar dispenser more responsive (less lag)
Only show the volume indicator readout when "show values" is selected in the concentration bar chart
Improved location of the "remove salt/sugar" button
Decreased beaker thickness
Only show labels (and tick marks) for 0 L, 1 L, and 2 L, and tick marks for 0.5 L and 1.5 L
Changed each crystal grain from 1E-6 moles to 1E-2 moles
Changed units to mol/L instead of M in concentration bar chart
Made the concentration bar chart visible by default
# 0.00.09 (51947) May 15, 2011
Made it so the sugar dispenser translates when dragged and rotates to pour out sugar to match the user interface of the salt shaker more closely while still allowing both to move about the screen
Show the conductivity tester probes as being submerged underwater
Removed concentration bar chart vertical axis, ticks and labels
Removed evaporation control from "microscopic" tab
Removed conductivity tester from "microscopic" tab
# 0.00.08 (51939) May 15, 2011
Added a vertical axis with tick marks and labels for the concentration bar chart
Moved conductivity tester tool behind the shakers
Made it so the conductivity tester can be dropped back in the toolbox
Made the bulb draggable
Added a draggable toolbox for the conductivity tester
Hid the red stage outline
Made it so you can’t let all the water flow out through output faucet, only up to faucet level
Fixed: When you let go of the faucet slider, it should snap back (even if the beaker is full or empty)
Fixed: When you let go of the evaporation slider, it should snap back (even if the beaker is empty)
Improved units for concentration value readouts
Show concentration values above the bars in the Concentration bar chart
Added a volume readout for the water
Added +/- buttons to show/hide the concentration bar chart
Made "show values" off by default and resets under "reset all"
Moved "show values" checkbox to the concentration bar chart
Removed "evaporate water" checkbox since the evaporation slider is always shown
Added an evaporation slider to the canvas and wired it up to the model
Fixed: cursor gets away from the salt shaker
Improved sugar shaker so it only rotates, and emits sugar when it is being rotated and pointed down and to the left (proportionate to the amount of rotation)
# 0.00.07 (51915) May 13, 2011
Improved salt shaker so it uses acceleration and deceleration along its axis to determine how much salt comes out
Fixed: salt shaker should only translate up and down and side to side, not rotate
Fixed: salt shaker doesn't reset on reset all
Fixed: salt shaker should be in front
Fixed: conductivity tester doesn't appear in the new coordinate frame
Added tick marks and labels for beaker volume
Fixed: bar charts fill up too quickly
# 0.00.06 (51903) May 13, 2011
Made the fluid start halfway up the beaker
Fixed units and make the beaker, shakers and faucets be the right size and in the right locations in SI units
Switched to semi-sweet chocolate as the default background color
# 0.00.05 (51898) May 13, 2011
Made it possible to modify background and salt colors with developer menu items
Removed "show concentration" checkbox, will be moved to a maximize/minimize button on the concentration bar chart
# 0.00.04 (51837) May 11, 2011
Removed workaround and improved probe initial locations
Moved solute selection closer to the shaker
Fixed: Offset fluid flow so it doesn't go past the bottom of the beaker
Moved the top faucet down a little bit, so the slider doesn't go offscreen
Improved the salt shaker
Show conductivity (and hence battery brightness) as linear with concentrations of salt ions
improved reset for conductivity tester and sugar dispenser
improved sugar pouring
improved user interaction for the sugar dispenser
5/9/11 Moved ConductivityTester and related strings and images from acid-base-solutions to piccolo-phet, see #2864
Fixed: Faucet shows fluid flow even when beaker is full
Reset the shaker location on reset
Made salt crystals square instead of round
Fixed: If you empty the solution, the bar charts go off-scale and stay that way when you add more water
Fixed: input faucet flows past the base of the beaker
Fixed water color for faucets
Added reset for water level, solute molarities, faucet flow levels and existence of crystals in the air
Moved the reset all button to the bottom right
Made it so the "remove solutes" button only appears if there are any solutes
Made water a lighter blue
Made the bar chart background the same color as the water
Made sugar and salt bars white in the concentration bar chart
Set the faucet flow back to zero when the user lets go, the user has to hold the slider to keep the faucet on
Moved salt bar to the left of sugar bar in concentration bar chart
Added water coming out of the faucets
# 0.00.03 (51620) May 6, 2011
Added a horizontal axis for the bar chart
Added a bar for sugar concentration
Fixed: when you remove the solution, the concentration changes
Fixed: the sim crashes when you empty out the entire solution
Added a button that removes solutes from the sim
# 0.00.02 (51613) May 6, 2011
Made background black and crystals white
made it so each grain of sugar and salt as 1E-6 moles (no randomness)
# 0.00.01 (51610) May 6, 2011
Added initial version of the bar chart
added concentration values to the model
Added sugar crystals
Added a beaker
added a shaker image
initialized application

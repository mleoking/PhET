Compute sugar and salt grain sizes based on size per solid precipitate
Made sugar and salt grains smaller weight, closer to physical grain sizes
Made the beaker stick up an additional 0.3 cm to accommodate expanded fluid volume due to dissolved solutes, so it won't overflow

# 0.00.15 (52161) May 18, 2011
Fixed: Underwater light bulb shouldn't light up (shorted out)
Moved "show values" button to a new control panel instead of in the concentration bar chart
Fixed: Crystals sitting on precipitate don’t get dissolved by water when water is added
Fixed: concentration should be moles divided by solution volume, not water volume
Made it so that dissolved solutes take up some volume proportionate to their volume per solid mole
Fixed: salt crystals should land on top of the white rectangle if it exists and there is no water
Fixed: Drain faucet doesn't handle solution properly when precipitate is present
Fixed: too many crystals particles can get added when falling onto the floor of the beaker
Salt particles land on the bottom (no stacking or bumping into each other), then when any water enters the system, go to clump form.
Fixed: If you empty out some solution or remove the solute after you reach the limit, and the salt shaker refills, it adds more salt to the solution on its own.
Limited the amount of water that can be added to the system to be 1.5L
Fixed: the top faucet is not showing a continuous stream of water as you move the slider to the right
Moved the conductivity tester probes down a bit to encourage the user to dip them in the water without dipping the light bulb in the water too

Made the solute appear as a rectangle taking up the full width of the beaker
# 0.00.14 (52087) May 18, 2011
Added collisions between the crystals and the beaker side walls
Made the clump grow faster so it matches with the displaced volume look as a linear function of the L/mole precipitate so sugar grows faster than salt (per mole)
Keep track of how many moles of crystal are in the air, since we need to prevent user from adding more than 10 moles to the system
Fixed: displaced volume isn't used for collision testing
Fixed: incorrect image for sugar dispenser when sugar is depleted
Show empty dispensers when user has already used the max amount of solute
Fixed: When a solute has 10 moles in the system, its dispenser shouldn't emit any more solute
Merged IntroModel with SugarAndSaltSolutionModel
Fixed: Water can overflow the beaker when solutes precipitate and you add water from the top faucet
Fixed: Crystals don't dissolve at the true top of the water (accounting for solid precipitate displacement)
Fixed: Solid precipitate should push up the water level, so that every mole of salt takes up 0.02699 L, and every mole of sugar takes up 0.2157 L
# 0.00.13 (52028) May 17, 2011
Fixed: probes get buried in precipitated clump of salt and can't be retrieved
Fixed: light rays intercept mouse events, making it difficult to use the upper faucet slider
Made so that any part of the conductivity tester probe conducts instead of just the very center of the tip
# 0.00.12 (52008) May 16, 2011
Changed brightness range so that it can accommodate the entire salinity range, up to saturation
Fixed: precipitate dissolves when draining liquid
# 0.00.11 (52005) May 16, 2011
Added saturation and precipitation
Refactored sugar and salt shakers to share the same code
Changed grain amounts to 0.05 mol for salt and 0.01 mol for sugar
Fixed: If you only put a little water (less than the height of the lower pipe) crystals fall past without getting absorbed
# 0.00.10 (51984) May 16, 2011
Fixed: if you press "reset all" when the tester is in the play area, it disappears from the sim

Changed each crystal grain from 1E-6 moles to 1E-2 moles
Changed units to mol/L instead of M in concentration bar chart
Made the concentration bar chart visible by default
# 0.00.09 (51947) May 15, 2011

Show the conductivity tester probes as being submerged underwater
Removed concentration bar chart vertical axis, ticks and labels
Removed evaporation control from "microscopic" tab

Made the bulb draggable
Added a draggable toolbox for the conductivity tester
Hid the red stage outline
Made it so you can’t let all the water flow out through output faucet, only up to faucet level
Fixed: When you let go of the faucet slider, it should snap back (even if the beaker is full or empty)
Fixed: When you let go of the evaporation slider, it should snap back (even if the beaker is empty)
Improved units for concentration value readouts
Show concentration values above the bars in the Concentration bar chart
Added a volume readout for the water
Added +/- buttons to show/hide the concentration bar chart
Made "show values" off by default and resets under "reset all"

Added an evaporation slider to the canvas and wired it up to the model
Fixed: cursor gets away from the salt shaker
Improved sugar shaker so it only rotates, and emits sugar when it is being rotated and pointed down and to the left (proportionate to the amount of rotation)
# 0.00.07 (51915) May 13, 2011
Improved salt shaker so it uses acceleration and deceleration along its axis to determine how much salt comes out
Fixed: salt shaker should only translate up and down and side to side, not rotate
Fixed: salt shaker doesn't reset on reset all
Fixed: salt shaker should be in front
Fixed: conductivity tester doesn't appear in the new coordinate frame
Added tick marks and labels for beaker volume
Fixed: bar charts fill up too quickly

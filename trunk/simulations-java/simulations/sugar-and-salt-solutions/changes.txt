Made it so that dissolved solutes take up some volume proportionate to their volume per solid mole
Fixed: salt crystals should land on top of the white rectangle if it exists and there is no water
Fixed: Drain faucet doesn't handle solution properly when precipitate is present
Fixed: too many crystals particles can get added when falling onto the floor of the beaker
Salt particles land on the bottom (no stacking or bumping into each other), then when any water enters the system, go to clump form.

Limited the amount of water that can be added to the system to be 1.5L

Keep track of how many moles of crystal are in the air, since we need to prevent user from adding more than 10 moles to the system
Fixed: displaced volume isn't used for collision testing
Fixed: incorrect image for sugar dispenser when sugar is depleted
Show empty dispensers when user has already used the max amount of solute
Fixed: When a solute has 10 moles in the system, its dispenser shouldn't emit any more solute
Merged IntroModel with SugarAndSaltSolutionModel
Fixed: Water can overflow the beaker when solutes precipitate and you add water from the top faucet
Fixed: Crystals don't dissolve at the true top of the water (accounting for solid precipitate displacement)
Fixed: Solid precipitate should push up the water level, so that every mole of salt takes up 0.02699 L, and every mole of sugar takes up 0.2157 L

Made the concentration bar chart visible by default

# 0.00.07 (51915) May 13, 2011
Improved salt shaker so it uses acceleration and deceleration along its axis to determine how much salt comes out

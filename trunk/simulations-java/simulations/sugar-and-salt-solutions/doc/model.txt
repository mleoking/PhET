Model description for Sugar and Salt Solutions

Macro Tab:

When salt is shaken out the shaker, each grain contains 0.2 grams.  Each sugar grain contains 0.4 grams of sugar.  The molar masses are given below:

salt molar mass = 58.4425 g/mol
sugar molar mass = 342.23134 g/mol

Displaced volume due to dissolved solutes is ignored in the simulation; it is a small value, but would be non-negligible if we chose to model it.

The conductivity tester brightness is a function of salt concentration, whether the probes are touching saline solution and whether the
conductivity tester is shorted out by having the battery or bulb touch water.

Micro Tab:

TODO: This section needs to be written after we finish writing that model

Water Tab:

Water is modeled using the 3-site model described here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_model but ignoring the Lennard-Jones terms
Note that this is a 2-dimensional model, all particles and interactions take place in the plane
+1/-1 point charges are put on each of the hydrogen/oxygen atoms in Sucrose
Na+ and Cl- have charges of +1/-1
Box2d is used to model the rigid body physics + coulomb interactions

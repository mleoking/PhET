//REVIEW For a relatively complicated sim, this is a disappointing amount of overview information.

Micro tab:
Simple module, the concentration of sugar and salt is computed as moles per volume and all displays update as necessary and there is no dynamic behavior

Macro tab:
Very complex sim, there are several types of solute (with different lattice structures) which the user can add.  There are many steps in the crystal lifecycle, and each must respect the formula ratio
for the crystal (such as NaNO3 or CaCl2):
1. Creation of a new crystal for the shaker, must have an integral number of formula units
2. Dissolving must dissolve one of each of the formula unit members
3. Incremental crystal growth (e.g. during evaporation) must acquire one of each of the formula unit members
4. When draining out, each member of the formula unit must leave the drain at the same time

By ensuring that all events happen in pairs (for NaCl or NaNO3) or in 2:1 ratio (for CaCl2) the concentrations have reasonable behavior.

The view in Macro and Micro are supposed to look similar (nearly identical), so the view is created first and mapped into
model coordinates to ensure that measurements and dimensions look the same in the view, while still giving correct model measurements.

Water tab:
JBox2D is used to model the collision and coulomb repulsion between particles in WaterModel.
JBox2D updates the model and those values are used to set the true model values, which then update the views, see WaterModel for more.

We implemented, but decided to remove the effect that solution volume increases as solutes are added.  The tricky part of implementing this would be that molesDissolved = f(moles, volume) and volume = f(molesDissolved).

The system can be solved analytically:

molesDissolved = min( moles, v x C )
v = a + b * molesDissolved
v = a + b * (min (moles, v * C))
molesDissolved = min(moles, (a+b*molesDissolved) * C)
I: molesDissolved = (a+b*molesDissolved) * C
II: moles
molesDissolved = a / (1/c - b) = a*c*(1-b*c)

and using a design like this:
class SolutionState{
    double volume;
    double dissolvedMolesOfSugar;
    double dissolvedMolesOfSalt;
}

But right now we will avoid the hassle.

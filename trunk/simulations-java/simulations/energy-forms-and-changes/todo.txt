Implement boiling and freezing of the water.
- Freeze from the top down.
- Boiling is essentially just steaming.
- Temperature stays fixed at 0, start freezing, E's come out as it is freezing, E's stop coming out when all ice.
- Temperature stays at 100 once boiling, never goes above.  E's coming out equals E's coming in.

Make it possible to measure temperature in the steam cloud, have temperature taper.

Make behavior change when E's are visible such that lights don't glow until they get energy, and so forth.

Improve steam shape for tea pot

Profile, have Chris test on Mac

--> Start interviews?

Fix: Long reset time.
Fix: Jittery E's in beaker
Make E's not cluster in the wires leading from solar panel.
Make E's not cluster in the output (spout) of the tea pot.
Fix: 1st tab, weird interaction between beaker and thermometer control panel. Just put panel at very back.
Internationalize E's (will need blank E's from NP).
i18n
Fix flicker when E's are transferred between energy systems

DONE: Make the E's go all the way into and out of the bucket on the 1st tab.
DONE: Implement the dotted E's on the generator so that the E's never disappear.
DONE: Make everything turn on all the way when getting energy, taper as energy is reduced.  Max energy from generator and solar panel should be the same.
DONE: Integrate bike with chain.
DONE: Scale solar panel.
DONE: Make some of the energy from the biker be thermal, have only this energy when she is biking by the solar panel.
DONE: E's should build up in heat coil before going into beaker.
DONE: No thermal E's on the fluorescent light bulb.
DONE: Add Reset All just under the legend
DONE: Make the straight segment a bit shorter, move energy users to the left.
DONE: Make energy chunks spread out on light build filament a little better.  Min speed probably.
DONE: Make thermal E's use black lettering.
DONE: Energy chunks should get opaque when emitted from beaker.
DONE: Energy chunks non-occluded when at top ellipse of beaker.
DONE: Make knob bigger for the faucet
DONE: Make beaker hold energy to a point, then release it
DONE: Thermals build up on filament of incandescent and then emit light, and some heat.
DONE: Thermals turn to light or stay, but emit at end when no more energies coming in.
DONE: Add beaker and thermometer
DONE: Get rid of ability to cool the tea pot.
DONE: Experiment: Make front of fluorescent bulbs programatically transparent when energy chunks present.
DONE: Experiment: Make tea pot transparent when energy chunks present.
DONE: Make some thermals come out of the tea pot spout
DONE: Make chem energy in biker change to mech at top tube.
DONE: Make biker always stop at spot where she is about to move
DONE: Make biker run out of energy chunks, then have "Feed Me" button appear
DONE: Tick marks on cloud slider
DONE: Remove 3rd tab for now
DONE: Integrate new images from Noah (droopy biker, new legs).
DONE: Fix issues with switching between energy sources - energy chunks are weird.
DONE: Make water "non-turdy"
DONE: Have energy chunks present when sun appears, rather than having to wait.

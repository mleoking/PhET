
Get rid of ability to cool the tea pot.
Experiment: Make front of fluorescent bulbs programatically transparent when energy chunks present.
Experiment: Make tea pot transparent when energy chunks present.

Make some thermals come out of the tea pot spout
Make chem energy in biker change to mech at top tube.
Make biker always stop at spot where she is about to move
Make biker run out of energy chunks, then have "Feed Me" button appear

Add beaker and thermometer
Make beaker hold energy to a point, then release it
E's should build up in heat coil before going into beaker.

Integrate Sam's way of making slider work
Figure out how to make E's not cluster in the wires leading from solar panel

Make water "non-turdy"

Make behavior change when E's are visible such that lights don't glow until the get energy, and so forth.

Have energy chunks present when sun appears, rather than having to wait.

Have some delay for lights and burner lighting up when energy starts to flow to it.

Internationalize E's
Make knob bigger for the faucet
Remove 3rd tab for now
Tick marks on cloud slider
Fix flicker when E's are transferred between energy systems
Profile, have Chris test on Mac

Make everything turn on all the way when getting energy, taper as energy is reduced.  Max energy from generator and solar panel should be the same.

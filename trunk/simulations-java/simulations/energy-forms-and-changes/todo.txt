
Make some of the energy from the biker be thermal, have only this energy when she is biking by the solar panel.
Make knob bigger for the faucet
Add beaker and thermometer

Thermals build up on filament of incandescent and then emit light, and some heat.
Thermals turn to light or stay, but emit at end when no more energies coming in.
Fluorescent same algorithm, but different params, so less thermals.
Heating element similar too.

Figure out how to make E's not cluster in the wires leading from solar panel.
Figure out how to make E's not cluster in the output (spout) of the tea pot.

Profile, have Chris test on Mac

Make beaker hold energy to a point, then release it
E's should build up in heat coil before going into beaker.

Integrate Sam's way of making slider work

Make behavior change when E's are visible such that lights don't glow until they get energy, and so forth.

Have some delay for lights and burner lighting up when energy starts to flow to it.

Internationalize E's
Fix flicker when E's are transferred between energy systems

Make everything turn on all the way when getting energy, taper as energy is reduced.  Max energy from generator and solar panel should be the same.


DONE: Get rid of ability to cool the tea pot.
DONE: Experiment: Make front of fluorescent bulbs programatically transparent when energy chunks present.
DONE: Experiment: Make tea pot transparent when energy chunks present.
DONE: Make some thermals come out of the tea pot spout
DONE: Make chem energy in biker change to mech at top tube.
DONE: Make biker always stop at spot where she is about to move
DONE: Make biker run out of energy chunks, then have "Feed Me" button appear
DONE: Tick marks on cloud slider
DONE: Remove 3rd tab for now
DONE: Integrate new images from Noah (droopy biker, new legs).
DONE: Fix issues with switching between energy sources - energy chunks are weird.
DONE: Make water "non-turdy"
DONE: Have energy chunks present when sun appears, rather than having to wait.

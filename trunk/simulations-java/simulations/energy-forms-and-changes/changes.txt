6/28/12 Publishing version to dev with only first tab for use in early interviews.
# 0.00.10 (65547) Jun 28, 2012
6/28/12 Snapshot for review.
Made the triangle of the thermometer change color based on what is being measured.
Adjusted thermometer behavior so that lowest and highest allowed temperatures match up with the lowest and highest tick marks.
Made energy chunks that are coming from the air into a thermal element be on top of the z-order until they reach the target object.
Made the thermometer appear to go inside the beaker, and to measure block temperatures in the beaker if over a block.
Made the clipping region that hides energy chunks behind blocks NOT do so when the block is beneath the beaker.
Changed the energy chunk distribution algorithm to fill up the water more quickly when something is dropped into the beaker.
Tweaked value at which a multi-body system is allowed to exchange energy with the air.
# 0.00.09 (65510) Jun 28, 2012
6/28/12 Deploying snapshot to dev for testing and review.
Made energy chunks exchanged between the liquid in the beaker and blocks immersed in the liquid only use visible chunks.

# 0.00.08 (65232) Jun 18, 2012
6/18/12 Deploying to dev to capture a snapshot before some significant refactoring.
Added back lines to the blocks.  These only show up when block is transparent.
Fixed an issue where heat/cool limits weren't being cleared if an object remained on the burner after the burner was turned off.
Made extraction of energy chunks work well in conjunction with the layering effect.
Added layers where the energy chunks reside in order to allow them to look more 3D in their positions.
Made energy chunks wander more as the move upwards through the air.
Made animation faster for burner turning off.
# 0.00.07 (65076) Jun 14, 2012
6/14/12 Snapshot of a version with incorrect, but interesting, behavior.
# 0.00.06 (65042) Jun 13, 2012
6/13/12 Capturing a snapshot for review and discussion with design team.
Added fading for energy chunks in order to give them more of a 3D look in the energy containers.
Changed algorithm for positioning energy chunks in the energy containers so that they can go into the 3D projection areas.
Animated turn off of the burner when heating/cooling limits are hit.
E's come from top center of objects when going into the air.
Improved energy chunk exchange behavior with air
Made the burners not interact with the air when something is on top of it.
Removed ambient heat chunks from the air.
Made check box not have focus at startup.
Added unique heat transfer constants for brick and iron, instead of treating both as just blocks.
Changed caption for the check box that shows the energy.
Added support for different heat transfer constants between the different categories of model elements, e.g. block to water, water to air, etc.
# 0.00.05 (64635) Jun 4, 2012
6/4/12 Snapshot for testing and reviewing changes to the behavior of the energy chunks.
Adjusted specific heats and energy-to-chunk mapping function to the point where energy chunk numbers look reasonably good.  This may be temporary.
Modified the energy chunk distribution algorithm to work without "jitter" at high densities and when Fast Forward is enabled.
Added a developer control that hides/shows a button that will dump the energies of the thermal objects to the console.
Adjusted the thermometers to work better with the temperature range.
Added limits to the burner to prevent it from over heating or over cooling items.
# 0.00.04 (64564) May 31, 2012
5/31/12 Snapshot for testing and review.
Changed the clock control panel to have "Fast Forward" instead of "Slow Motion".
Made water get more transparent when energy chunks are visible.
Replaced lead block with iron block, since iron has a greater specific heat value.
Removed label from thermometer tool box.
Made labels get transparent when blocks and beakers become transparent.

Adjusted block size so that both blocks will fit in the beaker.
Added the ability to remove blocks from the beaker.
Added displacement of the water when blocks added to beaker.
Made blocks snap to the center of the thing that they are stacked on when dropped.

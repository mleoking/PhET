# 0.00.06 (65042) Jun 13, 2012
6/13/12 Capturing a snapshot for review and discussion with design team.
Added fading for energy chunks in order to give them more of a 3D look in the energy containers.
Changed algorithm for positioning energy chunks in the energy containers so that they can go into the 3D projection areas.
Animated turn off of the burner when heating/cooling limits are hit.
E's come from top center of objects when going into the air.
Improved energy chunk exchange behavior with air
Made the burners not interact with the air when something is on top of it.
Removed ambient heat chunks from the air.
Made check box not have focus at startup.
Added unique heat transfer constants for brick and iron, instead of treating both as just blocks.
Changed caption for the check box that shows the energy.
Added support for different heat transfer constants between the different categories of model elements, e.g. block to water, water to air, etc.
# 0.00.05 (64635) Jun 4, 2012
6/4/12 Snapshot for testing and reviewing changes to the behavior of the energy chunks.
Adjusted specific heats and energy-to-chunk mapping function to the point where energy chunk numbers look reasonably good.  This may be temporary.
Modified the energy chunk distribution algorithm to work without "jitter" at high densities and when Fast Forward is enabled.
Added a developer control that hides/shows a button that will dump the energies of the thermal objects to the console.
Adjusted the thermometers to work better with the temperature range.
Added limits to the burner to prevent it from over heating or over cooling items.
# 0.00.04 (64564) May 31, 2012
5/31/12 Snapshot for testing and review.
Changed the clock control panel to have "Fast Forward" instead of "Slow Motion".
Made water get more transparent when energy chunks are visible.
Replaced lead block with iron block, since iron has a greater specific heat value.
Removed label from thermometer tool box.
Made labels get transparent when blocks and beakers become transparent.
# 0.00.03 (64309) May 23, 2012
5/23/12 Deploying to dev for review by design team.
Added thermometer tool box and made thermometer move to original location when dropped within the box.
Removed the thermometer shelf.
# 0.00.02 (63687) Apr 23, 2012
4/23/12 Publishing to dev for review of some aspects of the UI on the first tab.
Added movable visual representation of the thermometers.
Added texture to the brick.
Added z-order management so that blocks look correct when stacked on each other and placed beside one another.
Adjusted block and beaker sizes as well as displacement algorithm so that both blocks fit in the beaker and the water is displaced to cover both blocks and almost fill the beaker when both blocks are contained.
Adjusted block size so that both blocks will fit in the beaker.
Added the ability to remove blocks from the beaker.
Added displacement of the water when blocks added to beaker.
Made blocks snap to the center of the thing that they are stacked on when dropped.
Added beaker.
Added blocks.
Added burners.
Added shelves.
Added drawing for 2nd tab.
# 0.00.01 (62656) Mar 20, 2012
3/20/12 Deploying very first version to dev in order to test that project is correctly set up.
Added a drawing of the envisioned design to the main canvas as a sort of fast prototype.

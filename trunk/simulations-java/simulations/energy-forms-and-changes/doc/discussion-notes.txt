
Questions for next meeting:

How is change where air chunks traveling through the air go over everything until they arrive?

-------------------------------

Notes from 6/27/2012 meeting

Question about sticky thermometer: What should behavior be when dropped into beaker when attached to a block?
- Ans: For now, should go inside beaker and stick to block, and measure the block.

KINDA DONE: Chunks should move faster when block dropped in water so that user doesn't really see them move.
DONE: Tweak temp difference threshold for air to best value for interviews.
DONE: Fix clipping for beaker on top of blocks.
DONE: Magic thermometer - inside the beaker.  Measures block first, beaker 2nd, air last.  Burner is the same.
DONE: When a chunk comes out of the air into a thermal container, or goes out of the thermal container into the air, it should not pass through (or behind) any of the other thermal containers.
DONE: Thermometer triangle matches the color of the thing being measured.  Make a version with and one without, make both available for interviews.
Chunks moving between thermal energy containers when there are differences, and exchanges with air.  Address oddities.
Make the burner stands block motion of the blocks and beaker so things can't be dragged in front of them.
Tool tips for the speed controls are popping up in the wrong places on Mac, not seen on PC.

Notes from 6/21/2012 meeting:

Clipping look good?

How is the behavior of energy chunks when heating/cooling with nothing on burner?
- Mostly looks good.
- Should wander in more from the sides (not necessarily from directly above) when burner is cooling.

Do we need greater randomization of positions of chunks in the blocks?
- No, team thinks it looks reasonably good.

Holding off interaction with air until temperatures within a certain range.
- Team approved.

Infrared view (goggles or something)?
- Not too keen on this, since it shows temperature, not energy.

- Sticky thermometer - sticks to the thing that it is in contact with.

- Chunks have to come from outside the blocks when they are immersed in the beaker (could just do this all the time).

- Change captions - Normal and Fast Forward.



----------------------


Thermometer size
- Team says now good.

Cursor change when slider moves out from under it.

A little faster on the stove animation.

E's in the air - A little more range for wandering.

Add back lines for the cubes.

Stage I - Try clipping out the water E's somehow when the blocks are in the water.
Stage II - Squish the energy around the blocks, so that they are never in front or behind.

Developer control for inter-heat exchange constants.

---------------------------------------------------------


Energy chunks heating the air:
- Prototype is okay

- Blocks should cool down in air over time, ejecting E's, having one after a long time would be fine.

- Caption: "Energy Symbols".

Should the energy chunks emerge fully formed from the bucket?
- Fine the way it is on current version.

- Make the chunk density match the one that has the brick with one value at 0 C and 2 at room temperature.  There will be a lot in water.

- Try space filling, then some reasonable z-order layering but no size perspective.

- Animate the flame/ice going out rather than just disappearing.

Need to discuss how much to tweak specific heat values to get things looking good.
- Add a unique set of transfer constants for brick versus iron.

Okay to have only 1 E chunk removed to get to 0 C?
- Yes.

Demo the limits and get feedback.
- Team liked and approved.

Demo: Linear from 0 K with correct specific heat values.
- No good due to expected issues - not enough transfer of heat.

Demo: Brick has 1 at 0 K, 2 at room temp, correct specific heats.
- This is what the team wants.

Issue: Block on block on burner - limit is hit, then unhit.  Hysteresis?  Other ideas?
- Team feels that this is OK.

Does the E need to be translated?
- No, use the graphic, put graphic in control box.


------------------------------------

How to do 3D-ish energy chunk positions

Color scheme with E's and brick.

Limits on temperature changes - how to do

Different rates of energy transfer important?
- Yes, go ahead with it.

How is current quantity of E's?



-------------------

Had to modify chunks equation or there were too many at room temp.
Okay to have a min energy, and have a small number of energy chunks, and users can't reduce below that?  Won't scale lineraly to absolute zero.
- Okay as long as they have at least on chunk in them at min temperature.

Given specific heat of water and relative energy amount, should we use something other than lead?
- Try Iron

Can energy chunks overlap?

Design doc text says one block is iron, drawings show lead.  Which should it be?

- Use the white-encased E's
- Make the labels transparent when the objects go transparent.
- Make the water more transparent.
- Talk to Noah P about taller thermometer to make temp change more obvious.

- No label on tool box.

- Try making energy chunks on top but transparent.
- see if I can make the E's look more 3D is through layering and size, especially in water

- Talk with Noah about different color scheme for E's that doesn't interfere with brick.

Should have a reset on the first tab, right?

Down with the tool box for the thermometers?









--------------------

Where does energy go when cooling something down?  Does it flow back into the ice?
Ans: Yes.

What happens if they try to touch the thermometer to the flame or the ice?
Ans: It should show a value.

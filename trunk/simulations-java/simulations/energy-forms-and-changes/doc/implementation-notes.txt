
Convention

Property types (e.g. Property< Double > position) are public.  All other
attributes of a class are private and are accessed via accessor methods.

A convention used in this sim which is a bit unusual is that the position of a
2D model object is the center bottom of the objects shape, i.e. the center of
the shape in the x direction but the bottom of the shape in the Y direction.
This was done to make it easier to detect when a model object is sitting on a
surface.

Acceleration is used to make things fall to give it a more natural look.

Terms: A "resting surface" is a flat surface upon which other objects in the
model can rest.


Convention

Property types (e.g. Property< Double > position) are public.  All other
attributes of a class are private and are accessed via accessor methods.

A convention used in this sim which is a bit unusual is that the position of a
2D model object is the center bottom of the objects shape, i.e. the center of
the shape in the x direction but the bottom of the shape in the Y direction.
This was done to make it easier to detect when a model object is sitting on a
surface.

Acceleration is used to make things fall to give it a more natural look.

Terms: A "resting surface" is a flat surface upon which other objects in the
model can rest.

The burners are modeled as an energy containing model element, such as a block
of iron, but one that can increase or decrease its energy content based on the
position of the burner.

Also, burners generate or absorb energy chunks as needed by the other energy
containers when in the appropriate state (i.e. heating or cooling).  Unlike
the other energy containers, they don't calculate whether they have excess or
a deficit of energy chunks.

DESIGN ISSUES
- Laurie's # (or ratio) of particles for pH=6=8 (see her Excel document):
    pH      H3O+    OH-
    8.0      5      500
    7.5     16      160
    7.0     50       50
    6.5    160       16
    6.0    500        5
- how to combine color of liquid + water?
- what happens when dragging bars would result in pH outside range?

HIGH PRIORITY:

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- faucet doesn't turn on when filling via "reset all"
- port prototype code to this sim
- make particles of minority species more opaque
- hook up Ratio check box
- add bars to graph
- make bars interactive
- tick marks on graph
- implement linear and log scale switching
- add plumbing going into faucets
- 10x zoom feature for linear graph, zoom into zero

LOW PRIORITY:
- change layout of molecule counts display
- generalize layout code
- address Kathy's problem with prototype and Java 1.4 Random class

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON:

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects

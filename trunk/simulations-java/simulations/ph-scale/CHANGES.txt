Change history for ph-scale
================================================================================

DESIGN ISSUES
- make particles of minority species more opaque
- Laurie's # (or ratio) of particles for pH=6=8 (she will give me a formula):
    pH      H3O+    OH-
    8.0      5      500
    7.5     16      160
    7.0     50       50
    6.5    160       16
    6.0    500        5
- in beaker with ph=6-8, calculate #particles proportional to liquid volume
- in beaker, create particles only in liquid volume
- address Kathy's problem with prototype on Java 1.4
- linear option for bar graph, with zoom in/out x10 around 0
- label H20 concentration as "about 55" in bar graph
- where to position value in bar graph when bars are too small to contain them?
- negative pH support?
- remove H2O value in beaker
- make molecules large enough in beaker so that numbers fit inside of them

DESIGN ISSUES:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- add # moles concentration to model
- add concentration computation to model
- add counts to bar graph, hook up to model
- better looking beaker with tick marks
- port prototype code to this sim
- hook up Ratio check box

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- request confirmation when changing liquid ("Are you sure you want to empty the beaker?")
- add a check box to confirmation dialog ("don't ask me again")

LOW PRIORITY:

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON:

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects

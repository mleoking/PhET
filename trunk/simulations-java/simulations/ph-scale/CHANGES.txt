Change history for ph-scale
================================================================================

DESIGN ISSUES
- how to combine color of liquid + water?
- what happens when dragging bars would result in pH outside range?

HIGH PRIORITY:

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- replace JSliders on faucets with a Piccolo-based slider, for predictable look & layout
- add bars to graph
- make bars interactive
- tick marks on graph
- implement linear and log scale switching
- 10x zoom feature for linear graph, zoom into zero
- line up pH slider ticks with bar graph ticks
- generalize layout code

LOW PRIORITY:
- assign colors to the liquids
- can't align baselines of text and numbers drawn using HTMLNode
- pH text field isn't fully selected when it gains focus or when you double-click in it (PSwing issue?)
- add plumbing to liquid and water faucets?
- replace molecule image files with SphericalNode subclasses?
- change layout of molecule counts display?
- disable liquid and water sliders when beaker is full?

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON:

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects
- javadoc

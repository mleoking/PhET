Change history for ph-scale
================================================================================

DESIGN ISSUES

HIGH PRIORITY:
- create geometry for bars in graph
- make H3O and OH bars interactive
- Laurie can't run version 0.00.11, ScaleAlphaImageOpARGB.filter throws an UnsupportedOperationException in MoleculeCountNode

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- line up pH slider ticks with bar graph ticks
- adjust liquid colors
- adjust fill and drain rates

LOW PRIORITY:
- break up Liquid into a few smaller classes (separate pH model, fill/drain mechanism, etc) 
- generalize layout code
- can't align baselines of text and numbers drawn using HTMLNode
- pH text field isn't fully selected when it gains focus or when you double-click in it, selection is generally flakey (PSwing issue?)
- replace molecule image files with SphericalNode subclasses?
- disable liquid and water sliders when beaker is full?

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON:

CLEANUP:
- add cursors to all things that are interactive
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects
- javadoc
- organize imports

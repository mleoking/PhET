<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>use consistent colors for H2O, H3O and OH throughout (water, bars, molecules, particles, pH slider)
<li>adjust color of H2O molecule image (done by Archie)
<li>minor tick marks on beaker at 0.1L increments
<li>maximum beaker volume of 1.2L
<li>label only the 1/2L and 1L ticks on beaker
<li>volume readout that moves up the outside right edge of the beaker
<li>beaker is 15 pixels narrower to make room for volume readout
<li>add linearly variable flow rate to the faucets
<li>major model changes to support variable flow rate
<li>limit volume precision to 2 decimal places in the model, so that student calculations match what is displayed
<li>tweak clock framerate and faucet flow rates to support titration precision, while keeping fill/drain animation reasonably smooth 
(clock rate = 10 ticks per second, fastest flow = 1L/sec, liquid selection flow = 0.75L/sec)
<li>delete alternate "molecule counts" view, colors of its H2O image file was now out of date
</ul>

Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="ph-scale.jnlp">pH Scale</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>New algorithm for # of particles shown in "H3O/OH ratio" view.  See new developer controls for this algorithm, in the menu bar
under Developer.  The # of particles varies logarithmically with pH in the range 6 to 8.  Outside of this range, the # of particles
varies linearly.
<li>Counts of H3O and OH particles is displayed in lower-left corner of the beaker. This will appear only in development versions.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>no bars in bar graph
<li>no tick marks on bar graph
<li>pH slider scale doesn't line up with bar graph
<li>linear and log scale options for bar graph don't work
<li>no zoom buttons for linear graph
<li>layout and "look" of molecule counts is not as shown in design doc
<li>a small subset of liquids is provided
<li>liquid color does not change when diluted with water
</ul>
<p>
<b>Know issues:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>molecule counts are hard to see when "ratio" view is on
</ul>

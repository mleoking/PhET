<li><a href="ph-scale.jnlp">pH Scale</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>implemented Kathy's proposal for diluted liquid colors: draw liquid color on top of water color,
modulate the liquid color's alpha channel based on percentage of water in the beaker
<li>liquid color in beaker and drain faucet changes when diluted with water
<li>water color does not change when diluted with water
<li>liquid color coming out of left faucet is drawn on top of water color so that it matches color in beaker
<li>changed the color for drain cleaner and battery acid to the color we had for lemon juice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>no bars in bar graph
<li>no tick marks on bar graph
<li>pH slider scale doesn't line up with bar graph
<li>linear and log scale options for bar graph don't work
<li>no zoom buttons for linear graph
</ul>
<p>
<b>Know issues:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>molecule counts are hard to see when "ratio" view is on
</ul>

<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>add bars to bar graph
<li>if a bar is taller than the graph, add an arrowhead to the top of the bar, arrowhead extends slightly beyond top of graph
<li>drag handles can be used to change H3O and OH bars
<li>position drag handles at upper-left corners of bars, so they don't interfere with displayed values
<li>put drag handles in front of zoom buttons, so that drag handles are still accessible when they overlap zoom buttons
<li>constrain dragging of bars so that pH remains in range -1 to 15
<li>fix alignment of pH slider ticks and bar graph ticks
<li>rename "soda" to "soda pop"
<li>make beaker's minor ticks noticeably short than major ticks

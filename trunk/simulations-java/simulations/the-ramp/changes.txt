set applied force to zero on slider mouse release for all tabs
allow showing values outside the settable range for the applied force slider
bugfix in work calculation
robotmovingcompany: it looks like robot energy is only used up when the robot is pushing to the left.
robotmovingcompany: additional points (up to 100) for having battery left over
robotmovingcompany: add detection of game over and new game
robotmovingcompany: automatically go to next object when you score or lose the object (instead of hitting "next object" button)
# 1.03.13 (31267) May 3, 2009
Make "custom crate" text label match font for other labels.
Layout fixes for object selection panel.
fixed: Original forces checkbox should update when sim is paused.
robot energy refills after each object
for game tab, set applied force to zero on slider mouse release

10-13-2008: rename TheRampStrings to TheRampResources, move to top-level package, consistent with other sims
10-13-2008: replace SimString with PhetResources
10-13-2008: use PhetApplicationConfig launchSim
10-13-2008: fix incorrectly named string file for language=et
7-16-2007: Each module is given its own clock instead of sharing a reference.

New in 0.00.25 (8-18-2006)
Limited to 1 dog on screen at a time.
Renamed "remove heat" to "cool ramp"
Deleted extra print statements on the console on startup.

New in 0.23 (1-2-2005)
Upgraded to work with latest phetcommon
    -includes bugfixes for the control panel.
Fixed a bug that prevented the object combo box from being seen on a mac.
Performance improvements
Audio is preloaded as clips (for improved performance)

New in 0.22
.	Make applied force orange, make wall force the drab yellow.
.	Delete the ramp-change-color feature.
.	rename velocity to m/s (not meters/second).
.	Redraw track for slider to look more slider-like.
.	Scale down the mouse-applied force.
.	Shrink the control panel width (if possible).
.	Changing objects on the 1st panel also changes coeff. of friction.
		We mention the coeff in the object name as multi-line.
.	Earth should be lighter green (to make the dark fonts on it more visible).
.	“Playback” is better than “play” on the playback panel.
.	delete record button.  (Go/Pause is better than record)
.	Crate should have a higher coeff than the file cabinet.
.	Use “friction coefficient” not “friction” where applicable.
.	Bugfix: overheated button shows up in wrong spot (low resolution).
.	Add subscripts: F<sub>gravity, F<sub>friction, W<sub>applied, not for Energies, though.
.	Test 2 columns for in-plot readouts.
		>>Looks good.
.	Abbreviate the in-plot readouts (delete "parallel", delete units repetition, etc.)
.	Line up control buttons to the left of the graphs.
.	Bugfix: Dragging the playback cursor doesn't change values.
.	Bugfix: Dragging the block with friction off adds heat.
.	Bugfix: Clear heat doesn't work while pause is on.
		>> I think this was only clearing the heat for the ramp/block colors, now this feature has been removed.
.	When you make a change while it is paused, the change should be immediately seen. Including changing objects.
		>>I think this bug was in the plot readouts.
.	Reset should reset everything (including heat, object, time, graphs, controls, friction, frictionless checkbox).
		>>Fixed this for plot & bar graph states, and the frictionless checkbox.
.	Improve the drawing order of the graph lines (applied on top).
		>>I’ve simply increased the stroke size for the applied force plot.  Looks ok.
.	Bugfix: After 30 seconds, you can still press record, but nothing records.
.	Bugfix: On playback, sometimes the block jumps around (wrong surface data?)
.	Friction arrows aren’t updating after time runs out.
		>>I can’t reproduce this.


New in 0.21
.	Reduced size from 3.3M to 1.2M
.	re-enabled splash screen.
.	Fixed a bug that prevented the application from starting properly in Java 1.5.0+

New in theramp 0.20
.	Audio checkbox is on the right, titled 'Sound'.
.	Wall force is brown.
.	Sleepy dog is back.
.	Different audio for run-over man.
.	Applied force label is above applied force spinner.
.	Moved the 'overheat message' to the bar graph area, only appears if bar graphs are up
.	Renamed 'clear heat' to 'remove heat' in the control panel.
.	Height readout is now halfway down, with 'height extent' lines.
.	Changed the verify dialog text to clarify the difference between "Clear Graphs" and "Reset Everything"
.	Added Go Pause Clear buttons to the control panel (near the position & angle controls)

New in theramp 0.19 on 10-9-2005
·	Bugfix: the ramp no longer mistakenly starts overheated on replay.
·	Wall force color has been changed to avoid clashing with the normal force color.
·	Colors no longer combine on the graphs, the more important lines overlap the others.
·	The ramp starts at a slight angle.
·	There is a checkbox to enable the draggable zero-point potential graphic, now only available in the advanced panel.
·	The graph vertical axes are now labeled.
·	The Advanced function of showing multiple forces now adds labels to each entry (for disambiguation).
·	The man no longer screams.
·	Labels and numbers no longer cover graph area.
.	Added a mute button.

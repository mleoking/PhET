To Do List for Greenhouse Effect
================================
- put IR filter in GlassPane
- Filter.pass may be wrong
-try making PhotonGlassPaneCollisionModel non-static 

- When switching between modules, there is a long delay

-When you make the frame small, the control panel gets cut off
-Use Piccolo tabbed panes, or at least make them bigger

- Under the ice age, the visible photons are reflecting off of the
ice way above the ground.  The problem is worse when the sim is
enlarged to full screen

maybe photons should be interleaved instead of yellow in front and red in back

70F is actually quite hot for the equilibrium surface temperature of the earth ... remember its the whole planet and its the 24 hour average.

Angie and I ran a phet workshop for teachers today as part of the Research Experiences for Teachers program.

One of the teachers gave us some feedback on The Greenhouse Effect sim.
  Since I'm not sure who's on the design team for this sim, I'm sending it to everyone:

He suggested that when you change the level of greenhouse gases, there should be some physical indication of what's causing it, like a factory producing smoke when you turn the level up, and trees growing when you turn it down.  Also, he wondered why, no matter how high you turn up the greenhouse gasses, the temperature never seems to get much higher than about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  I didn't know.

===============
- On glass panes, in full screen there is a drawing bug when you flip
between glass panes and greenhouse effect? Also a bug that is always
there ... photons from top and bottom but none in middle. This panel
should behave like the greenhouse panel ... when you go back to it,
it should pick up where you left off.
- On glass panes, put PhET logo?
- On glass panes layer, hide the IR photons behind the glass so it
looks like they are being absorbed and emitted by the surface. (But
keep the glass looking hazy).
- The haze layer goes all the way to the top of the drawing
- Photons are reflecting off the snow now, not above it.
- Flashes are in the right place (but only when the window is in its original size.  See below.)
- Photons scale with the size of the window.

2.00.04
====================
-Add "None" and "Lots" as endpoints on the slider
-Splash screen comes up in Spanish
-Scale the thermometer when window resizes

2.00.03
====================
-The look and feel is cleaned up.
-The spinners can't be typed into, but can still be spun. Before, if you typed in an out-of-range number, nothing.happened. This was the simplest solution, and works well because the acceptable values are just 1, 2 and 3.
-When running on Java 1.4, the native Windows look and feel is now used. This looks better than the old Metal L&F.
-When you're in an "Atmosphere during.." other than "Adjustable" and you click on the slider, things switch to "Adjustable."
-All backdrops rescale properly.
-Added a splash startup screen with a progress bar.
-Fixed the Spanish label on the reset.
Change back ground from Metal.
Set slider track to better color for 1.5.
background color of Galss Panes module needs to be updated
Pollution overlay isn't registered properly when resizing. Sometimes get a black area along the top.
When resizing, only the current background image gets resized properly.
Slider should respond whenever it's clicked on


Finish functionality of reset button, and add one to the glass pane panel.
Make a decision on how to implement the response to clicking on the concentration slider.
Incorporate newer control panel infrastructure.

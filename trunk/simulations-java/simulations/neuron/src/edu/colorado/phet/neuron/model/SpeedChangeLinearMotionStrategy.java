 * This is a very specialized motion strategy that is basically a linear
 * motion but that starts at one speed and then changes to another.  It was
 * created for a very specific application - getting particles to move quickly
 * away from the exit of a channel with an inactivation gate, and then slowing
 * down.  It may have other applications.

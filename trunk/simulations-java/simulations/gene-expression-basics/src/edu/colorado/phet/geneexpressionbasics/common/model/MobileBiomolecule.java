 * within this simulation.  This base class provides the basic infrastructure
 * for defining the shape, the movement, and the attachment behavior (i.e.
 * how one biomolecule interacts with others in the simulation).  The specific,
 * unique behavior for each biomolecule is implemented in the subclasses of
 * this class.


General rules about how the biomolecules interact with one another.

General idea: Here is what a biomolecule does at each time step:
- Moves.
- Updates its "attachment state", which determine how it will move during the
  new time step.



At each step in time, a biomolecule first moves based on its current motion
strategy.  After this, it looks at its attachment state and decides whether
to seek out any new attachments.  If it is available for attachments, it will
poll other molecules that it could potentially attach to in order to see if
there are attachment sites that are open and are close enough to attach to.  If
so, the biomolecule will start moving towards one of these sites.

Biomolecules propose attachments to other biomolecules.  If the biomolecule
that receives the proposal has an attachment site that is close enough and is
open, it will generally accept the attachment request.

Attachment sites can only have one biomolecule attached at a time.

Attachment sites are not typed themselves.  It is up to the individual
biomolecules to keep track of which attachment sites are appropriate for which
biomolecules.  This was done because it is possible in some cases to have one
attachment site pertain to a number of different types of biomolecules.

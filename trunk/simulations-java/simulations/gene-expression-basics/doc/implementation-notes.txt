Summary: Here is what a biomolecule does at each time step:
- Moves.
- Updates its "attachment state", which determine how it will move during the
  subsequent time step.

At each step in time, a biomolecule first moves based on its current motion
strategy.  After this, it looks at its attachment state and decides whether
to seek out any new attachments.  If it is available for attachments, it will
poll other molecules that it could potentially attach to in order to see if
there are attachment sites that are open and are close enough. It does this by
"proposing an attachment" to the other biomolecule(s).  The convention for this
is that each biomolecule has a method called "considerProposalFrom", and the
type signature specifies the proposer.  If a proposal is accepted, an
attachment site is returned, and the proposing biomolecule will start moving
toward that site.

Biomolecules propose attachments to other biomolecules.  If the biomolecule
that receives the proposal has an attachment site that is close enough and is
open, it will generally accept the attachment request.  Once a proposal is
accepted, the proposing molecule starts moving toward the attachment site on
the accepting molecule.

Motion Strategies

The motion of each biomolecule is controlled by a motion strategy, which is a
class that essentially decides where the molecule should go next in model
space at each time step.  For the most part, the motion strategy is set by the
molecule's attachment state machine (more on attachment state machines below).

Question to self: Are there places where the ASM doesn't set the motion
strategy and, if so, why is it necessary to do this?

Attachment Sites

Attachment sites can only have one biomolecule attached at a time.

In each attachment that occurs, there is an attacher and an attachee.

Attachment sites do not specify the tip of biomolecule that can attach to it.
It is up to the individual biomolecules to keep track of which attachment sites
are appropriate for which biomolecules.  This was done because it is possible
in some cases to have one attachment site pertain to a number of different
types of biomolecules.

12/12/2011 - Here's a thought: Should there be two attachment sites involved
in each attachment?  Then, when they overlap one another, the attachment has
been made.  This way, the attacher and the attachee can behave more
symmetrically than they currently do.

Attachment State Machine

There are many aspects of the way that biomolecules interact with each other
that is common to all or most of the biomolecules.  In order to enable reuse
of the code that controls this behavior, the design encapsulates the attachment
behavior in an Attachment State Machine.  Each mobile biomolecule has one of
of these.  The state machine is designed so that each subclass of mobile
biomolecule can use as much or as little of the default attachment behavior as
needed.




Note about something to add: I should say that the desired behavior is
often intended to emerge from the model, and is not explicitly directed.

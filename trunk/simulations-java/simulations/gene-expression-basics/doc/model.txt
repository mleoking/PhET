
Model Notes for the Gene Expression Basics Simulation

Protein synthesis in living cells is a very complex process.  The Gene
Expression Basics simulation depicts a version of protein synthesis that is
simplified in order to present enough information for students to understand
the basics of the process without overwhelming them with they myriad details
and variations.

Here are some of the simplifications that were made:
o The process being portrayed does not show the mRNA moving out of the nucleus,
and is thus essentially showing a prokaryotic, as opposed to a eukaryotic,
cell.
o The genes being transcribed are significantly shorter (in terms of the
number of base pairs) than real-life genes. On average, a real gene in a
prokaryotic organism is 1000 base pairs, whereas the genes in this simulation
contain less than 100 base pairs.
o Ribosomes are available to the user in "pre-assembled" form, meaning that
the large and small subunits are already together, rather than having the
subunits come together as mRNA transcription begins.
o Individual amino acids are not depicted.
o Transfer RNA (tRNA) is not depicted.
o Protein folding is not depicted.
o The sizes and shapes of the biomolecules were inspired by the drawing in "The
Machinery of Life" by David S. Goodsell.

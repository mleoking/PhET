# 0.00.12 (60483) Jan 20, 2012
1/20/12 Publishing to dev for potential use in classroom setting.
Temporarily removed the Protein Levels tab so that a version with only working tabs can be published.
Renamed tabs.
Changed the background color on all tabs to be black when outside of a cell.
Changed cell placement algorithm on 3rd tab to look more random and therefore realistic.
Added a dialog that shows real E. Coli cells in the 3rd tab.
Change cell shapes to look roughly like E. Coli.
Added zoom in/out feature on 1st tab.
Completed integration of numerical model on 3rd tab.
Got mRNA destroyer working.
# 0.00.11 (59967) Jan 6, 2012
1/6/12 Snapshot of version reviewed with biology expert.
Implemented first cut of third tab, which allows the user to tweak cell parameters for one or several cells and see how protein levels change.
Fixed an issue where mRNA would be above the ribosome in the z-order in some cases, which looked weird.
Added placement hint for mRNA destroyer.
Added "capture signal" to the protein capture area.  This is a flashing node that surrounds the location where the protein is moved when captured.
# 0.00.10 (58851) Nov 29, 2011
11/29/11 Deploying to dev as a snapshot for use in discussions with design team.
Added infrastructure and stubbed out implementations (i.e. static pictures) for 2nd and 3rd tabs.
Made biomolecules move directly and quickly to attachment sites, rather than doing a "directed wandering".
Changed the motion of wandering biomolecules to be faster and have a longer mean free path.
Implemented the ability to capture proteins in the collection box.
Added protein collection box node.
Added protein production from ribosomes.
Got mRNA positioning and winding algorithm working, supports multiple simultaneous translation and translation during transcription.
# 0.00.08 (56347) Sep 9, 2011
9/9/11 Snapshot for review and some initial testing.
Added some random shaping to the mRNA to make it be a bit curvy.
Got hints for transcription factors and polymerase working.
Added ability for polymerase to produce mRNA
Added ability for polymerase to exhibit the "transcription motion" on the gene.
# 0.00.07 (55950) Aug 31, 2011
8/31/11 Deploying to dev to capture a snapshot
Added 1D random walk when attached to DNA for molecules with general DNA affinity.
# 0.00.06 (55793) Aug 25, 2011
8/25/11 Taking a snapshot before making some major changes.
Fixed an issue where biomolecules removed from the DNA would jump back to it.
# 0.00.05 (55514) Aug 19, 2011
8/19/11 Deploying to dev for review by design team.
Added attachment sites and the ability for polymerase and transcription factors to attach to DNA.
Added negative transcription factor.
Added support for hints and added initial set to first gene.
Added gradients to biomolecules.
Made strand longer so that ends are not seen when overall aspect ratio is reasonable.
Made 1st gene be centered at (0,0) in model space so that initial scrolling doesn't occur.
Made shape of RNA Polymerase look like suggested by design team.
Improved layout of biomolecule tool box
Retitled "Tool Box" to "Biomolecule Tool Box"
# 0.00.04 (53478) Jun 24, 2011
Made ribosomes into a single unit instead of two subunits
Added tool boxes and ability to add/remove biomolecules using these tool boxes
6/24/11 Publishing to dev for review of DNA look and navigation.
Added base pairs to DNA molecule
Improved the size and coloration of the prototype genes.
Added genes to the model
Improved panning behavior
Made DNA strands curved instead of linear

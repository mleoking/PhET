We've added an automatic update feature. When you download a single simulation or the whole website to your local computer for offline use, the simulation will tell you if there is a newer version available. That way, when we fix bugs or do upgrades, you'll know about it! (You can turn this feature off if you like).
> 3) We've upgraded all of the Flash sims so that they are now translatable into other languages. (The Java sims have had this capability for quite a while). 
> These changes required A LOT of internal software upgrades. We've done as much testing as we can from here, so we think it's all working correctly. But, we'd really appreciate your help in our beta testing which has just started. We posted 2 simulations with our new features which we are hoping you will run and let us know if you run into any errors or find anything confusing. We'll need you to test 1 Java and 1 Flash sim since the code for those are separate.
> 
> For the Java simulation, please test the Sound sim:
> 1) Go to the simulation page here: http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/sims.php?sim=Sound
> 2) Use the "Run Now!" button to run the simulation online, and report any troubles.
> 3) Use the "Download" button, and click "Save" to save it to your computer. Then run the downloaded file and report any troubles. For this version, please confirm that you can easily find the new PhET Software Agreement under the Help->About menu, and can select your preferences under the File->Preferences menu.
> 
> For the Flash simulation, please test the Charges and Fields:
> 1) Go to the simulation page here: http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/sims.php?sim=Charges_and_Fields
> 2) Use the "Run Now!" button to run the simulation online, and report any troubles.
> 3) Use the "Download" button, and click "Save" to save it to your computer. Then run the downloaded file and report any troubles. For this version, please confirm that you can easily find the new PhET Software Agreement under the About button, and can select your preferences under the Preferences button.
> 
> If you have the time (another 10 minutes), we also need folks to test the PhET Offline Website Installer (this installs a full copy of the website onto your computer for local access). Please download and install the PhET Offline Website Installer here:
> http://phet.colorado.edu/get_phet/full_install.php
> Once installed, open your local copy of the PhET website. And then test these same simulations, Balloons and Static Electricity and Charges and Fields.
> 
> If you normally run a sim in another language, please do these two tests with the translated sims.
> 
> Thanks much!

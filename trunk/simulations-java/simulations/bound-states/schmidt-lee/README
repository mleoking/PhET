<b>Visualizer-Solver for the One-Dimensional Schrodinger Equation</b>
<p>
This directory contains the Schmidt-Lee applet that can be found at

This applet is a "visualizer-solver for the one-dimensional Schrodinger Equation".
We've installed it here to make it easier for the Bound States development team to access.

<b>Running using Java WebStart...</b>
<br>
To run using Java Webstart, click <a href="schmidt-lee.jnlp">here</a>. 
Be forewarned that the Read/Write (and Print?) features will not work when running via WebStart because of Java security issues. If you need those features, see below.
<p>
<b>Running as a stand-alone application...</b>
<br>
If you need the Read/Write features, then download schmidtlee.jar to your computer.
After downloading the JAR, simply double-clickable on the JAR file to launch the application.
<p>
<b>About the .txt files...</b>
<br>
The .txt files can be read into the Schmidt-Lee applet by pushing the Read button below the graph.
(You'll need to download the files to your computer to read them.)
These files are useful for comparing behavior with PhET's Bound States simulation.
There are 1-well files for each of the Bound States well types.
There are 2-well files for Coulomb and Square wells.
The parameters to V(x) in each file are as follows:
<ul>
<li>offset = offset
<li>d = depth
<li>w = width
<li>s = spacing (separation for square wells)
</ul>
<p>
Mass is assumed to be 1 x electron mass (5.68).

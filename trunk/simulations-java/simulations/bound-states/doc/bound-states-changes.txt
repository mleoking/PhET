Changes to "Bound States Design Outline Draft 2" (March 2, 2006) 

Interaction with eigenstates in Energy chart:
- interaction is similar to http://falstad.com/qm1d/
- as the mouse is moved over a line (or close to a line) the line's color is changed to the "highlight" color
- if the mouse is over a well drag handle, no eigenstate line is highlighted
- the wave function for the highlighted eigenstate is drawn in the Wave Function chart
- if performance becomes an issue, the simulation won't be compromised if we don't show the wave function for the highlighted eigenstate
- how the highlighted eigenstate's wave function is displayed depends on which views the user has selected; 
  the first view checked is used.
  If the only view selected is phase, highlighted wave function should be in "magnitude" view.
- clicking on a line selects that line and its color is changed to the "selection" color
- when a line is selected, all previous line(s) that were selected are deselected
- the user may select only one line via this interface; there is no multiple selection
- more than one line may only be selected by setting more than one non-zero coefficient in the Superposition dialog
- at least one line is always selected
- all colors will be trivial for the programmer to change

Additional eigenstate controls:
- a new control (menu) will be added to the control panel for choosing an eigenstate
- eigenstates are labeled E1...En, where E1 corresponds to the eigenstate with the lowest energy
- eigenstates for the harmonic oscillator well are labeled starting with E0
- the last menu choice is "Superposition"; if this choice is selected, the Superposition dialog is opened
- when the Superposition dialog is closed, the menu selection is updated to be consistent with the selected eigenstates

Interaction with wells in the Energy chart:
- a double arrow icon will be used for manipulating offset
- the offset arrow will look different than the other arrows (solid, versus outlined)
- the offset arrow can be dragged to the upper and lower bounds of the energy range (y-axis)

Configure Energy dialog:
- non-modal (users can interact with other parts of the sim while this dialog is open)
- 1 slider each for width, depth, offset (and spacing when # wells > 1)
- changes made are immediately visible in the play area's Energy chart
- Close button, no confirmation necessary since all changes are immediate
- no combo box for changing potential
- no chart
- no equation

Superposition dialog:
- non-modal (users can interact with other parts of the sim while this dialog is open)
- one coefficient for each eigenstate
- coefficient labels start with c1 (exception: c0 for harmonic oscillator)
- spinners with range 0-1 (can type in these)
- equation above spinners
- Apply, Normalize, and Close buttons
- Apply button is enabled when a change has been made
- nothing is changed in the play area's Energy chart until the Apply button is pressed
- if Apply button is pressed when coefficients are not normalized, the user is prompted to normalize
- if Close button is pressed when changes haven't been applied, the user is prompted for confirmation
- no chart; changes are reflected in the play area's Energy plot
- initial values displayed are based on the eigenstate line(s) selected in the Energy chart

Miscellaneous:
- the "Show energy values" checkbox is dropped
- the "Measure Position" button is dropped (and so is need to solved time-dependent Schrodinger equation)
- particle mass slider shows the current value as a multiple of electron mass (eg, 10.2 me)
- when in a superposition state, the equation in the upper-right of the Wave Function chart is replaced by "Superposition"
- use the common stop watch used by other PhET sims, always visible at the lower left; "show stopwatch" control is dropped
- when switching between well types, their state is maintained
- Save/Load feature is added as in QT
- will be developed as 1 simulation with 3 panels (One Well, Double Well, Many Wells), delivered in 1 JAR file
- you'll be able to configure which panels are visible via the JNLP file

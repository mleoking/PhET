Bound States -- flowchart

TI = time-independent
TD = time-dependent

UC0: update display
1. get coefficients of selected eigenstates
2. show all eigenstates with non-zero coefficients as selected
3. get TI wavefunction for all eigenstates with non-zero coefficients
4. change position axis scale to fit all excited portion of all TI wavefuctions
4. convert to TD wavefunctions
5. sum TD wavefunction using coefficients
6. display TD wavefunction sum in Wave Function chart

UC1: select one eigenstate
1. set selected eigenstate's coefficient to 1
2. set all other eigenstate coefficients to 0
3. do UC0

UC2: select N eigenstates
1. set all selected eigenstate coefficients to non-zero (normalized sum)
2. set all unselected eigenstate coefficients to 0
3. do UC0

UC3: hilite one eigenstate
1. get wavefunction for hilited eigenstate
2. display TI wavefunction in Wave Function chart

UC4: set superposition coefficients
1. select all eigenstates that have a non-zero coefficient
2. do UC0

UC5: a change is made to the potential or particle:
1. calculate eigenstates and wavefunctions
2. do UC1 with lowest eigenstate as the selection

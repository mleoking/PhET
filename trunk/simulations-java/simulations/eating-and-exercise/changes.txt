>When dragging an item to the bar chart, it will move to a random position on the plate (or exercise log)
>Converted control panel background to green
>Made control panel fonts bold
>The play/pause/step buttons are be disabled when you reach the 2 year mark, re-enabled on chart area clear or sim reset
>Horizontal zoom allows you to zoom in from 2 years, and out to a maximum of 2 years.
>Changed bar chart zoom buttons to look like graph zoom buttons
>Fixed: Reset all does not reset the calorie axis for the bar charts.
>Fixed: When calories drop back down, the zoom buttons go away but the axis does not rescale, so you can end up with a rescaled axis that you can not get back to the standard view (unless you add lots of calories to make the zoom buttons return).
Fixed a problem with NaN during MuscleAndFatMassLoss2 that was causing stack overflow (due to inequality of NaN with each other)
>Fixed: Can't edit values for height when in metric
>Fixed: Red arrow appears on weight slider after changing units

New in 0.00.84
Fixed: String not found on startup: serving-cream-filled-cookies
Converted to use new PhetApplicationConfig constructor
If a person drags food to the bar chart for food  it settles onto the plate and if they drag exercise onto the cal burned bar chart it settles into the book.
Fixed: Exception when dragging food items on/off plate
Fixed: Initial help item does not point to start button
Fixed: Made the wiggle-me go away on either play or next month.
Fixed: The vertical zoom buttons for bar charts are not equal in size.
Time charts go to 2 years instead of 1.
Stop time at the end of the chart (2 year maximum duration of simulation).

New in 0.00.83
Trial version for usage tracking.

New in 0.00.82
Fixed: clicking on "metric" twice disables all radio buttons
Fixed: Use the "losing focus" method instead of incremental updates + 5 second sync to accept data from text boxes in control panel

New in 0.00.81
Adjustments for stomach sizes, including gender dependence

New in 0.00.80
Fixed: Out-of-range value entered in the slider text box doesn't properly revert to accepted value
    Value reverts after 3 seconds

New in 0.00.79
Fixed: Heart should be more unhappy when heart strength is low (right now it still looks a little happy)
Removed "?" box next to happy heart.
Fixed: Muscles should be smaller for thin person. Almost negligible when BMI gets near 18.
    Changed muscleWidthBeyondArm from leanMuscleFraction to max( leanMuscleFraction * leanMuscleFraction - 0.2, 0 )
Made textboxes update incrementally as values are entered.

New in 0.00.78
(changes by Noah P.)
added Activity Level to muscle building formula
added multipliers for muscle and fat mass loss (last two variables in each line)
Modified formula for calculating % fat based on height, weight so that BMI and % fat better match expected values. Also removed age dependence for simplicity.

New in 0.00.77
Heart strength/strain indicators move up with human when window is maximized.

New in 0.00.75
Changed bar chart elements to have icon on the left, then title and label with same font on the right
Changed bar chart axis graphics to be more sparse

New in 0.00.74
Increased readability of categories and values for the stacked bar chart at small sizes
Changed the male/female defaults to:
    Male default height: 5'8", weight 150 lb
    Female default height: 5'5", weight 135 lb
Previously, height and weight were preserved under gender change.  Now the values change to the new defaults when changing gender.
Fixed the animated drag help items to appear on mouse press instead of mouse drag

New in 0.00.73
Muscle diameter for females is 75% of the muscle diameter for males
Added new images and changed order for exercise

New in 0.00.72
Edited help dialog text
Fixed: "Reset All" needs to reset the activity level selector
Balanced diet dialogs are disposed during reset all
Items disappear if you drop them in the play area, but not on the plate/exercise log
Added year month format to control panel
Changed label on graphs from "Time" to "Age"
Changed year month format on graph horizontal axes
Added an animated help message that appears when you start to drag a food or exercise item that suggests you put it on the drop target
Fixed: BMR doesn't reset properly (during reset all) if activity level was changed

New in 0.00.71
Changed the layout to have the green control panel background extend to the top. This required moving some of the play area objects to the right. This was based on the "eating and exercise layout.pdf" in the doc directory as a guide - we used the "Modified 1" layout.
Made the Heart Strength indicator dependent on activity level as well as exercise.  Since the values for exercise and activity are month-long averages, it is inconvenient to set the days for which the person was very-sedentary to zero, so instead the following algorithm is used: activityToCount = max( ( averageActivity - 100 ) * 0.75, 0 )
Made the multiplier for fractionFatLost in MuscleAndFatMassLoss depend on gender:
    -changed multipler (was 3.0) to 3.5 for male, 2.8 for female
    -changed limiter for FatMassPercent (was 0.33) to 0.28 for male, .35 for female

Removed developer controls, including model controls and color choosers
Fixed: BMR at simulation start is different than BMR after reset all

New in 0.00.70
Changed the activity level values
Made the "Starving" and "heart attack" warnings larger and move more to the left to be in the open play area.
Made arrows (currently "<" and ">") on each side of the food/exercise boxes say "< More" and "More >" on the left and right, respectively.
Fixed textual descriptions for activity levels
Added a warning box when choosing reset all.
Fixed: When I switch from female to male, the body fat slider now has two brown rounded rectangles. As soon as I clicked on it, it corrected itself.

New in 0.00.69
Activity calories burned is now proportional to weight rather than BMR

New in 0.00.68
Added developer control
Changed model parameters in muscle gained from exercise and muscle and fat mass loss
Changed from 7716 cal/kg to 9000 cal/kg for fat and 4000 cal/kg for muscle

Increased slope for low values of exercise in nonlinear effect on heart strength
Improvements for food & exercise lists

New in 0.00.62
Set the heart strength to start closer to the green instead of in the red by populating the simulation 100 days of 2000 calorie/day exercise.
Added log based model for exercise/heart strength
In the range 6-25% men, 16%-31% women, the amount of heart strain is 0, and outside of this range, the amount of heart strain is proportional to the distance to the closest point in this range.

New in 0.00.57
Moved health indicators behind drag and drop panel (tooltips were obscured)
Converted muscle gained from exercise algorithm to use exercise only (instead of exercise + activity)
If net calories are gained, then 100% goes into fat in Step 1 (used to be 88% rule as in net calories lost), Step 2 can still convert some exercise into muscle

New in 0.00.55
Fixed: Graph time range doesn't update when the user modifies the age
Clicking on the track of the slider changes its value.
Changed exercise time increment from 1 hour to 15 minutes
Cleaned up food and exercise text
Improved model for weight loss (88% fat)
Heart attack probability is based on heart health, not previous model
Added button for estimating body fat percent, see http://www.halls.md/bmi/fat.htm
Added heart health information button
Converted to use the same 12% rule for weight gain as weight loss (this makes the muscle gained from exercising algorithm less important)
Removed "simulation age out of range" message

New in 0.00.54
Clean up foods and exercises

New in 0.00.53
Added new foods and exercises

New in 0.00.52
Finished adding fast food meal and coffee drink to menu

New in 0.00.51
Fixed: Play area scale doesn't respect control panel height.
Fixed: Default height was 6'4" (should probably be put back to 5-8 or 5-6 for female?)
Fixed: New sliders need to update when units change english/metric
Fixed: New sliders need limits on type-in values
Added aligned layout for sliders
Fixed: If I set a value beyond the slider, the arrow comes up (very nice) but the tip of the arrow is cut off.
Fixed Layout: Move up baseline of buttons and bar chart, make graphs fill width and height
Fixed: The "Starving" message did not come up immediately below a certain body fat (4% female / 2% male). It came up only after body fat reached 0% (as far as I could tell).
Fixed: If I set a height and weight and adjust body fat, the muscles get smaller, but the rest of the body does not get bigger.
Added activity level combo box to control panel.

New in 0.00.50
Changed starving message to �Starving!�
Changed game over OK button to �Restart�
Changed heart attack message to "Increased risk of heart attack."

Added warnings and game-over due to heart attack or starvation
Updated exercises to be weight-dependent

Dragging an item back to the toolbox removes the item
Fixed: Draggable icons should disappear on simulation reset or when removed from edit dialog
Fixed: Reset all should clean up extra draggable icons

New in 0.00.39
Moved BMI readout to near the heart
Fixed: "?" icon should move with the heart
Removed BMI readout from control panel (now near heart only)
Fixed: I think you can do without the per day label on all the foods.  One label for the box could say Base Diet per day. Then all the rest will be obvious.
Renamed "Diet" to "Foods". Diet means eating less so you can lose weight to most people.
Renamed "non" (from non-muscular) to "fat"
Fixed "muscular" label so it doesn't disappear off the panel
Changed "press play" help item to appear after adding 3 items to exercise or foods; works with new drag & drop interface
Changing gender sets fat free mass percent to the typical minimum for that gender
Fixed decimal format in tooltip readouts

New in 0.00.36
Added drag and drop
Provide a few foods and exercise up front (in drag toolbox), but access to more via scrolling or Edit button
Fixed: Resize panel after "start sim" wiggle me is showing causes exception
Made food and exercise drag work by mouseover, not by release, to make it easier to see changes
Internationalized food and exercise repository by moving keys to food/exercise files and translatable strings to fitness-strings.properties file

Removed disclaimer phrase regarding common sense.

New in 0.00.28 (5-7-2008)

Bugfix in help items
Added "/" as delimiter for feet/inches
Fixed: Sometimes the weight graph doesn't clear all data lines on reset.

New in 0.00.27 (5-7-2008)
Fixed: The x-axis on the graph needs to rescale with the input age (most of our kids are 15-16, but the x-axis begins at 22 years regardless.
    When the simulation is paused and the age changes, the charts domain resets.
Added unit labels on the time series graphs
Fixed: There is confusion about height input.  We need an inches box.  If a kid is 5' 5", they are putting in 5.5 ft instead of 5.41 ft.  This is messing up their BMI
    Set to the format, e.g. 5' 8" and decimal for metric
Added peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
Added animated help items for edit diet and Play button

New in 0.00.26 (5-6-2008)

Fixed: Vertical zoom shouldn't go below zero
Fixed: Horizontal zoom works properly
    horizontal range maintained on chart reset
Fixed: Zoom in/out should have better behavior
Fixed: Charts ranges should reset on sim reset
Added ability to change weight units between metric and english
    Chart vertical range reflects this change as well.

Removed "Restart" button from clock controls
Fixed: Sim should not be running on startup
Reduced simulation rate to 30% of previous rate
Added other base options for diet, including "none"
Fixed: Layout for food summary panel should update after food removed
Fixed: Character Graphic: 180 lbs should look much fatter
Fixed: Fix blinking stroke graphic on the character
Fixed: Rename "fat-free mass" to "Other" or "non-fat" mass, sounds too much like "fat-free" used in foods.
Fixed: Need better carbs pic for bar chart

    I have been playing with the Simulation this morning and had a question for you.
    If in this simulation it appears that the change in percent body fat is at a high rate when making even the smallest change.
    I had a diet that I let run for a few years that was 50 cal above my energy expenditure and i watched my %
    fat go up by about 15% in a few years and then when I added a walking exercise (one of the lowest calorie expenditures)
    in a matter of 1 year I went from 30% body fat to about 10% body fat. I was wondering if there
    was a way to slow down the change in % body fat. i am not sure if it is equation based and has a time function built in,
    but that portion is not very realistic, so i thought i'd point it out.

In the sim, when you go beyond 1 year, nothing happens in the charts.

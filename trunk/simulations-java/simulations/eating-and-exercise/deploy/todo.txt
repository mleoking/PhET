From Wendy 10/7/08:

         Reset all doesn뭪 work well when I make my guy really fat

         Hit next month, then choose more sedentary activity level and the person gets a bigger belly. Time is paused so there should be no change. This only happens the first time you adjust activity level after pausing (hitting next month).

         Make it so that if a person drags food to the bar chart for food it settles onto the plate and if they drag exercise onto the cal burned bar chart it settles into the book.

         If you chose next month instead of play to first start, the wiggle me does not go away.

         The vertical zoom buttons for bar charts are not equal in size.

         Stop time after 2 years

         Heart strength reaction to activity level




-make male/female not reset unless it is the first thing that is done

-make %fat slider bounce back when at limits of BMI (upper limit is 36 now)

-make muscle gained balance out based on average exercise

-make neck as wide as torso

-taller person should have bigger head

-make arm muscles scale properly with height

-make stomach scale properly with height

>>NP: the appearance of muscles and stomach seems to be affected by the overall body size. The overall body thickness does not scale with height it seems.

-add/subtract foods and exercises from WA:

Food:

-find metal container for large milkshake
-make frappuccino cup look like cold drink
-make slow running slower
-

Exercise: finish adding pictures for new exercises

-Consider making different weight bearing activities have different multipliers (e.g., rock climbing more weight dependent than backpacking, etc.)

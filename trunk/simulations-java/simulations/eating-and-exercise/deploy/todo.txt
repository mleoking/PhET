Noah: construct text for heart ? explanation

Add heart ? that shows text

Finish adding images for food and exercise

The green area of each bar will mean good, red bad. The bright green area should be extended to include all acceptable values.
So for heart strain, base this on 6-25% for men, 16-31% for women. (See below in CALCULATING BODY FAT... for where these values come from.)

MUSCLE GAINED FROM EXERCISING

keeps mass constant, changes only % fat

>>SR: How does this relate to the MUSCLE AND FAT MASS LOSS section?
>>SR: Does this account for lifestyle/activity, or just exercise?

   - there should be some muscle gained from exercising, to a point. This should be limited (you can only get so muscular).
   I had trouble finding anything on this, so I made up a model that seemed reasonable.

>>>Model: For every calorie exercised, all of the calories are burned.
In addition, your body tries to make 10% of that number of calories into muscle, at a rate of 1/4 g of muscle per calorie.
So for example, if you do 1000 calories of exercise, all of those calories are burned.
In addition, 100 calories of what you eat are are turned into muscle (or 25 g).
These calories are in addition to those burned to do the exercise itself.
At this rate, one would build about 1 lb of muscle in 18 days, which seems reasonable.
There is also feedback so that the more muscle you have, the less you can build,
and at some point you cannot get any more muscular.

>>>Model for muscle building from exercise:

	Muscle_mass_gained = 0.1 * Cal_exercise * (LBM_0 - LBM)
	
	...where LBM is lean body mass, LBM_0 is 0.96 * sqrt(height / 30),
	or the lean body mass of a person with 4% body fat and a BMI of 30.

>>>These two features above will effectively make BMR vary according to
your caloric intake (if you undereat, your BMR should drop some to compensate, vice versa for eating more and exercising).
   
>>> all other weight gained is added fat mass.

 	The equations below for muscle gained due to exercise still have the
algebra error.  LBM_O = W *96% = BMI*h2 * 96%  You also don't mention this
is for men and that women would be 91% and BMI 26 I think you found.  I also
don't see the muscle mass loss due to lack of exercise.

Performance: consider profiling or changing clock rate
    >>How severe is this problem?

Time readouts should be Years:Months, not years in decimal
    >>Wait for interviews

Need explanations for different activity levels from Noah
    >>Come up with definitions for different lifestyles

Fix text for "simulation age out of range" message
    >>Remove the warning

Added calculation for body fat % based on height, weight and activity level
    >>SR: Perhaps this should be a relative model instead of an absolute model so that changes are tracked
    >> and so that making a minor modification to one parameter doesn't dramatically change the body fat %

Should the click-to-move slider feature have a cursor hand?
    >>Reduce clickable area, and add cursor hand

    I have been playing with the Simulation this morning and had a question for you.
    If in this simulation it appears that the change in percent body fat is at a high rate when making even the smallest change.
    I had a diet that I let run for a few years that was 50 cal above my energy expenditure and i watched my %
    fat go up by about 15% in a few years and then when I added a walking exercise (one of the lowest calorie expenditures)
    in a matter of 1 year I went from 30% body fat to about 10% body fat. I was wondering if there
    was a way to slow down the change in % body fat. i am not sure if it is equation based and has a time function built in,
    but that portion is not very realistic, so i thought i'd point it out.

In the sim, when you go beyond 1 year, nothing happens in the charts.
 Maybe they should scroll as you advance beyond 1 year?

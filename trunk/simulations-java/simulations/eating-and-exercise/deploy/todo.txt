--Check for extra extra carriage returns in the eating-and-exercise-strings. NP may have messed these up by opening in Notepad with wordwrap on.

--Make the "Starving" and "heart attack" warnings larger and move more to the left to be in the open play area.

--Make arrows (currently "<" and ">") on each side of the food/exercise boxes say "< More" and "More >" on the left and right, respectively.

--Add these descriptions to the help menu for activity levels:

	Very Sedentary:  You are sitting or lounging most of the day. You are on your feet moving around only a few times a day

        Sedentary:  You move around to do normal daily activities.  Your job is mainly sitting at a desk.

        Moderately Activity: You walk around a fair amount. Your job or school includes being on your feet or moving around.  You often take the stairs instead of the elevator.

        Very Active:  You are constantly on the go, active for a large part of the day. Your work involves continuous activity and medium exertion is part of your daily activities.


--Should have a warning box when choosing reset all.

--Sometimes reset all clears the body, leaving the head...instead of resetting. Not sure how to reproduce this, but it has happened several times.

--For a little while my weight slider had a red arrow head instead of the tan rounded rectangle?

--When I switch from female to male, the body fat slider now has two brown rounded rectangles. As soon as I clicked on it, it corrected itself. I couldn’t’ get it to do it again.

--Add a quick paragraph in the Help that says something like "Change your diet by putting food on/off the plate. Change your Activity level by using the pull down menu or moving exercise on/off the book."

--Make sure dev control for color is removed in final version. (And other dev controls we've added.)

--When Lifestyle calories burned is calculated, is that based on LBM (i.e., fat free mass) or weight? Wendy and I think it should be based on total weight, so just wanted to check.

--Label should change on exercise log. "Daily Exercise", "Exercise Log" or maybe just "Exercise" in the book where it now says Today.

--Shouldn’t’ the reset all button be part of common code and just come with the warning box?

--Instead of the question mark next to the pull down for activity, is it possible to have a mouse over on each option that gives the description?

	>Sam, what do you think of this? I think mouse-overs on pull down menus are fairly non-standard, but I could be wrong.

--(Unfuddle #682) I think the midsection bulge (the belly) should be smaller when the % fat is low. When the person is near the bottom of the healthy range (for men or women), the midsection bulge should be almost imperceptible. Right now, you can have 0 body fat and you still see a little bulge around the midsection.

--Sam, is there a way to make this into some sort of Year/Month format? Maybe YY/MM, and the axis label can say "Time (Years/Months)".

--Questions from  WA:

> 1. Why does changing my age change my body fat?
>
> 2. We were going to have the sim figure out a reasonable body fat based on height, weight, sex and activity level. I’m not seeing any 
>adjustment for activity level. Is this still on the todo list (which is missing from the directory so I can’t look) or was it not included in >the model?

I believe Sam is using the following model for body fat: http://www.halls.md/bmi/fat.htm

It uses BMI, age, and gender...but not activity level. We could augment it to include activity level - we'll have to guess at this, but a good starting place might to assume this is the average "Sedentary". Add maybe 3% for Very Sedentary, and subtract 3% for Moderate Activity, subtract 6% for Very Active. How does that sound?

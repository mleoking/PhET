There seems to be a bug where you can't enter values for height when set to metric values. You can't change the values with the slider either (you can move the slider but it does not change the value.)
Also, when you switch back to English it makes a red arrow on the weight slider. You should be able to reproduce this by setting to metric, move the weight slider, set back to English.

-make male/female not reset unless it is the first thing that is done

-make %fat slider bounce back when at limits of BMI (upper limit is 36 now)

-make muscle gained balance out based on average exercise

-make neck as wide as torso

-taller person should have bigger head

-make arm muscles scale properly with height

-make stomach scale properly with height

>>NP: the appearance of muscles and stomach seems to be affected by the overall body size. The overall body thickness does not scale with height it seems.

-add/subtract foods and exercises from WA:

Food:

-Consider making different weight bearing activities have different multipliers (e.g., rock climbing more weight dependent than backpacking, etc.)

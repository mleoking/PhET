--(Unfuddle #682) I think the midsection bulge (the belly) should be smaller when the % fat is low. When the person is near the bottom of the healthy range (for men or women), the midsection bulge should be almost imperceptible. Right now, you can have 0 body fat and you still see a little bulge around the midsection.

--When Lifestyle calories burned is calculated, is that based on LBM (i.e., fat free mass) or weight? Wendy and I think it should be based on total weight, so just wanted to check.
>>This should be done in 0.71.

--Questions from  WA:

--Shouldn’t’ the reset all button be part of common code and just come with the warning box?
>>Appears to be fixed in v0.71.

I believe Sam is using the following model for body fat: http://www.halls.md/bmi/fat.htm

It uses BMI, age, and gender...but not activity level. We could augment it to include activity level - we'll have to guess at this, but a good starting place might to assume this is the average "Sedentary". Add maybe 3% for Very Sedentary, and subtract 3% for Moderate Activity, subtract 6% for Very Active. How does that sound?
>>Fixed in v0.71.

Sam, what do you think of this? I think mouse-overs on pull down menus are fairly non-standard, but I could be wrong.


>>Should the help be integrated into the play area?  It will take longer than a pop-up text dialog window.

--Sometimes reset all clears the body, leaving the head...instead of resetting. Not sure how to reproduce this,
but it has happened several times.
    >>SRR 8-11-2008: I haven't been able to reproduce this yet.

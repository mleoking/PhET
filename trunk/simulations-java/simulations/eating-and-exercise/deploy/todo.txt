-make arm muscles scale properly with height

-add/subtract foods and exercises from WA:

Food:

Remove pomegranate, beets, brussle sprouts, plain yogurt
Add grapes, chicken, fish, beef, pancakes, eggs, rice, butter and cream
cheese

NP: keep plain yogurt, add flavored yogurt

Exercise:

Remove either walking dog or walking for pleasure, sitting in class,
watching sporting event, one or two of the boating activities and
unicycling.
Add - tennis should have both singles and doubles. 
Modify stroller with baby (not kid) seems odd that it's less calories than
walking the dog/walking for pleasure. Golf with cart shows calories higher
than walking the dog or non-competitive volleyball - makes no sense.
Canoeing does not need qualifier of while camping. 

NP: remove walking the dog, sitting in class, watching sporting event.
Tennis doubles about 1/2-2/3 calories of singles.
Make stroller with baby slightly higher than walking for pleasure.

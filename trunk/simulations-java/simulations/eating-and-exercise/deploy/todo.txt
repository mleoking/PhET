From WA 10/15/08:

-When I was playing the step button was grey for the first couple of years and then it became visible. It did still work?



From NP 10/15/08:

- With the new play/pause/step buttons, it is not at all clear that the step is a "next month". Can you put a label next to it that says "Next Month" as there was before?
>>This has a tooltip; is that sufficient?

NP says: Not sure. Let's just wait and see what turns out to be necessary on this.


- The wiggle me points in the general direction of the play/pause/step buttons, but still not directly at the play button. Can it be made closer to the play button? Or at least to the left so it is directly above the play button.
>>This will be difficult and/or messy

NP says: OK, it is fine the way it is.


- The time does not stop at 2 years. The play/pause/step buttons should be disabled when you reach the 2 year mark.

- Horizontal zoom should allow you to zoom in from 2 years, and out to a maximum of 2 years.

- The new chart zoom buttons look better, but it would be more consistent if they looked like the vertical zoom buttons on the charts. This is low priority, especially if it is very time consuming.

- Reset all does not reset the calorie axis for the bar charts. Also, when calories drop back down,
    the zoom buttons go away but the axis does not rescale, so you can end up with a rescaled axis
    that you can not get back to the standard view (unless you add lots of calories to make the zoom buttons return).

WA says: I really like the larger area for placing food and exercises!  It’s very useful for clueless users such as myselfJ

NP says: Don't worry about it in this case. We can see if it is really an issue in interviews.


From Wendy 10/7/08:

Reset all doesn’t work well when I make my guy really fat
    >>NP says: I have seen it make the body disappear on reset, but I have not been able to reproduce this report from Wendy.

Hit next month, then choose more sedentary activity level and the person gets a bigger belly. Time is paused so there should be no change. This only happens the first time you adjust activity level after pausing (hitting next month).
    >>NP says: Wendy saw this, but I was not able to reproduce. Will check with her to get more details.

·         Heart strength reaction to activity level

After making this change:
    Stop time at the end of the chart (2 year maximum duration of simulation).
What should be the new behavior of the horizontal zoom buttons?  We used to only allow zooming out on horizontal axis.  Should we remove horizontal zoom buttons?  Allow zooming in?
NP: see above.

-Consider making different weight bearing activities have different multipliers (e.g., rock climbing more weight dependent than backpacking, etc.)

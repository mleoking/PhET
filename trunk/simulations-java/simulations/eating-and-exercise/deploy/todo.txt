From Wendy 10/7/08:

Reset all doesn’t work well when I make my guy really fat
    >>NP says: I have seen it make the body disappear on reset, but I have not been able to reproduce this report from Wendy.

Hit next month, then choose more sedentary activity level and the person gets a bigger belly. Time is paused so there should be no change. This only happens the first time you adjust activity level after pausing (hitting next month).
    >>NP says: Wendy saw this, but I was not able to reproduce. Will check with her to get more details.

The vertical zoom buttons for bar charts are not equal in size.

Make the time charts go to 2 years. Stop time at the end of the chart (2 year maximum duration of simulation).

From NP 10/9/08

-make male/female not reset unless it is the first thing that is done

-Consider making different weight bearing activities have different multipliers (e.g., rock climbing more weight dependent than backpacking, etc.)

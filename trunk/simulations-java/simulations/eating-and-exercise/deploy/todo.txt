--Sometimes reset all clears the body, leaving the head...instead of resetting. Not sure how to reproduce this, but it has happened several times.

--For a little while my weight slider had a red arrow head instead of the tan rounded rectangle?

--When I switch from female to male, the body fat slider now has two brown rounded rectangles. As soon as I clicked on it, it corrected itself. I couldn’t’ get it to do it again.

--Add a quick paragraph in the Help that says something like "Change your diet by putting food on/off the plate. Change your Activity level by using the pull down menu or moving exercise on/off the book."

--Make sure dev control for color is removed in final version. (And other dev controls we've added.)

--BMR at simulation start is different than BMR after reset all

--When Lifestyle calories burned is calculated, is that based on LBM (i.e., fat free mass) or weight? Wendy and I think it should be based on total weight, so just wanted to check.

--Label should change on exercise log. "Daily Exercise", "Exercise Log" or maybe just "Exercise" in the book where it now says Today.

--Shouldn’t’ the reset all button be part of common code and just come with the warning box?

--Instead of the question mark next to the pull down for activity, is it possible to have a mouse over on each option that gives the description?

	>Sam, what do you think of this? I think mouse-overs on pull down menus are fairly non-standard, but I could be wrong.

--(Unfuddle #682) I think the midsection bulge (the belly) should be smaller when the % fat is low. When the person is near the bottom of the healthy range (for men or women), the midsection bulge should be almost imperceptible. Right now, you can have 0 body fat and you still see a little bulge around the midsection.

--Sam, is there a way to make this into some sort of Year/Month format? Maybe YY/MM, and the axis label can say "Time (Years/Months)".

--Questions from  WA:

> 1. Why does changing my age change my body fat?

I believe Sam is using the following model for body fat: http://www.halls.md/bmi/fat.htm

It uses BMI, age, and gender...but not activity level. We could augment it to include activity level - we'll have to guess at this, but a good starting place might to assume this is the average "Sedentary". Add maybe 3% for Very Sedentary, and subtract 3% for Moderate Activity, subtract 6% for Very Active. How does that sound?

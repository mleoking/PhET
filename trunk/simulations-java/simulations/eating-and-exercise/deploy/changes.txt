New in 0.00.27 (5-7-2008)

    When the simulation is paused and the age changes, the charts domain resets.
Added unit labels on the time series graphs
Fixed: There is confusion about height input.  We need an inches box.  If a kid is 5' 5", they are putting in 5.5 ft instead of 5.41 ft.  This is messing up their BMI
    Set to the format, e.g. 5' 8" and decimal for metric

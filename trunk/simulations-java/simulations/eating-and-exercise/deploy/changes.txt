Moved health indicators behind drag and drop panel (tooltips were obscured)
Converted muscle gained from exercise algorithm to use exercise only (instead of exercise + activity)
If net calories are gained, then 100% goes into fat in Step 1 (used to be 88% rule as in net calories lost), Step 2 can still convert some exercise into muscle

New in 0.00.55

Clicking on the track of the slider changes its value.
Changed exercise time increment from 1 hour to 15 minutes

Heart attack probability is based on heart health, not previous model
Added button for estimating body fat percent, see http://www.halls.md/bmi/fat.htm
Added heart health information button
Converted to use the same 12% rule for weight gain as weight loss (this makes the muscle gained from exercising algorithm less important)

Fixed: Play area scale doesn't respect control panel height.

Fixed: New sliders need to update when units change english/metric
Fixed: New sliders need limits on type-in values
Added aligned layout for sliders
Fixed: If I set a value beyond the slider, the arrow comes up (very nice) but the tip of the arrow is cut off.
Fixed Layout: Move up baseline of buttons and bar chart, make graphs fill width and height
Fixed: The "Starving" message did not come up immediately below a certain body fat (4% female / 2% male). It came up only after body fat reached 0% (as far as I could tell).
Fixed: If I set a height and weight and adjust body fat, the muscles get smaller, but the rest of the body does not get bigger.
Added activity level combo box to control panel.

Tooltips should always show when grabbing an item, and disappear when dropped
Renamed to Eating & Exercise
Removed "Athletic Lifestyle"
Slider text box values can go outside the slider range
Default range on graph changed to 1 year instead 5 years.  Time runs more slowly (1/4 as fast)

Dragging an item back to the toolbox removes the item
Fixed: Draggable icons should disappear on simulation reset or when removed from edit dialog

New in 0.00.39
Moved BMI readout to near the heart
Fixed: "?" icon should move with the heart
Removed BMI readout from control panel (now near heart only)
Fixed: I think you can do without the per day label on all the foods.  One label for the box could say Base Diet per day. Then all the rest will be obvious.
Renamed "Diet" to "Foods". Diet means eating less so you can lose weight to most people.
Renamed "non" (from non-muscular) to "fat"
Fixed "muscular" label so it doesn't disappear off the panel
Changed "press play" help item to appear after adding 3 items to exercise or foods; works with new drag & drop interface
Changing gender sets fat free mass percent to the typical minimum for that gender

Fixed a bug that made "Next Month" button clear the graphs
Removed disclaimer phrase regarding common sense.

New in 0.00.28 (5-7-2008)
Fixed: If the user enters an out-of-range value for height, then changes units, the wrong value is set.  Also happens at the boundaries of the range.
Bugfix in help items
Added "/" as delimiter for feet/inches
Fixed: Sometimes the weight graph doesn't clear all data lines on reset.

New in 0.00.27 (5-7-2008)
Fixed: The x-axis on the graph needs to rescale with the input age (most of our kids are 15-16, but the x-axis begins at 22 years regardless.
    When the simulation is paused and the age changes, the charts domain resets.
Added unit labels on the time series graphs
Fixed: There is confusion about height input.  We need an inches box.  If a kid is 5' 5", they are putting in 5.5 ft instead of 5.41 ft.  This is messing up their BMI
    Set to the format, e.g. 5' 8" and decimal for metric
Added peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
Added animated help items for edit diet and Play button

New in 0.00.26 (5-6-2008)

Fixed: Difference between green cal and red cal lines unclear.  Is one cal in and one cal out?
Fixed: Rename readouts to "caloric intake" and "caloric burn", make sure they don't overlap
Changed x-axis to be in years
Changed default vertical ranges
Fixed: Weight graph sometimes disappears after rescale or units change
Fixed: Scaling is confusing. x and y axis calibration is set out of range on graphs
Fixed: Vertical zoom shouldn't go below zero
Fixed: Horizontal zoom works properly
    horizontal range maintained on chart reset
Fixed: Zoom in/out should have better behavior
Fixed: Charts ranges should reset on sim reset
Added ability to change weight units between metric and english
    Chart vertical range reflects this change as well.

Reduced simulation rate to 30% of previous rate
Added other base options for diet, including "none"

Fixed: Character Graphic: 180 lbs should look much fatter

Implementation notes for Molarity sim

Package structure was motivated by the fact that this sim was originally a "Dilutions" sim with multiple tabs.
Stuff under the "common" subpackage was used by all modules; stuff under the "molarity" subpackage was specific to the Molarity tab.
All tabs except Molarity were ultimately dropped, making the package organization somewhat obsolete.
While I did prune code specific to abandoned tabs, I didn't think that reorganizing the package structure was a good use of time.

This sim uses Property<T> throughout the model and view for storage of properties and notification of changes.

Since spatial units (distance, size, location) have no relevance to the model, there is no model-view transform.
The model uses the view coordinate frame, where positive x is to the right, and positive y is down.

For the purposes of view layout, the origin of view components is generally described in each component's javadoc.
If the origin isn't documented, you can assume the Piccolo default (upper-left).

I find that I frequently need to change the rendering order and layout of nodes and canvases.
To make this easier, node and canvas constructors typically have this structure:

    public MyNode(...) {

        // instantiate nodes

        // set rendering order (addChild)

        // do layout (setOffset)

        // register property observers
    }

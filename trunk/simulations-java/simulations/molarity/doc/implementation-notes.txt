Implementation notes for Molarity sim

This sim uses Property<T> throughout the model and view for storage of properties and notification of changes.

Since distance and location have no real relevance in this sim, there is no model-view transform.
The model uses the view coordinate frame, where positive x is to the right, and positive y is down.

For the purposes of view layout, the origin of view components is generally described in each component's javadoc.

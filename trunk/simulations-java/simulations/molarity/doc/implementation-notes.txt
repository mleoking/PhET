Implementation notes for Molarity sim

This sim uses Property<T> throughout the model and view for storage of properties and notification of changes.

This sim has no model-view transform; the model uses the view coordinate frame.
Positive x is to the right, positive y is down.

For the purposes of view layout, the origin of view components is generally described in each component's javadoc.

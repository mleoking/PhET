Capacitor Lab model

// constants
epsilon_0 = vacuum permittivity, F/m = 8.854E-12
epsilon_a = dielectric constant of air, dimensionless = 1.00058986

// settings
V = battery voltage, volts (-10 to +10)
d = plate separation, meters (.005 to .010)
L = plate side length, meters (.010 to .020)
offset = how far dielectric is pulled out, meters (0 to .020)
epsilon_r = dielectric constant, dimensionless (1 to 10)

// derived
A = plate area, meters^2 = L * L
A_dielectric = area dielectric between plates, meters^2 = ( L - offset ) * L
C = capacitance, Farads = ( ( A_dielectric * epsilon_r / A ) + ( ( A - A_dielectric ) * epsilon_a / A ) ) * ( epsilon_0 * A / d )
Q = plate charge, Coulombs = C * V
Q_excess = excess plate charge, Coulombs = (epsilon_r - epsilon_a) * epsilon_0 * (A_dielectric / d ) * V
sigma = surface charge density, Coulombs/meters^2 = Q / A
E_effective = effective field, Volts/meter = sigma / ( epsilon_r * epsilon_0)
E_plates = field due to plates, Volts/meter = sigma / epsilon_0
E_dielectric =field due to dielectric, Volts/meter = E_plates - E_effective
U = stored energy, Joules = 0.5 * C * V * V

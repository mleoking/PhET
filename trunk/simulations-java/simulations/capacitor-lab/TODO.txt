TODO list for capacitor-lab

HIGH PRIORITY
- utilities for computing important 2D points on capacitor's pseudo-3D geometry (for layout, interactivity, and connecting things)
- plates and their drag behavior
- dielectric, its drag behavior, and its resize behavior relative to plates
- add dielectric constant to model
- pattern for dielectric material (relationship between model and control)
- add locations to model?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY

LOW PRIORITY

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

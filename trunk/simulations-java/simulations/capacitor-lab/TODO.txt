TODO list for capacitor-lab

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH
- do you really want units spelled out for meters, or is abbreviation OK?
- discuss zoom buttons on meters: clearly identify the problem, prove that zoom buttons are a solution
- how are we addressing attempts to create AC behavior by dragging battery voltage slider?
- discuss how (whether) to address issues of overlapping stuff in play area

HIGH PRIORITY
- why is Eclipse suddenly not finding inner classes?
- solve coordinate frame conversion issues for drag handles
- fix behavior of plate size drag handle, whose axis is on the diagonal of the top plate (should drag point be on a line perpendicular to this axis?)
- utilities for computing important 2D points on capacitor's pseudo-3D geometry (for layout, interactivity, and connecting things)
- blue arrow and glowing sphere to represent dV/dt
- charge and excess charge on plates (see notes)
- charge and excess charge on dielectric (see notes)

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- add zoom buttons to meters?
- combine plate charge meter and slider into one thing?
- make dielectric draggable by grabbing it
- derive PlateChargeMeterNode.MAX_EXPONENT and PlateChargeControlNode.VALUE_EXPONENT
- edges where dielectric and bottom plate meet don't match up perfectly
- use air as the dielectric material in Introduction module
- make air dielectric invisible
- fake curvature in E-field?
- add a dashed line around "detecting plane" for field meter

LOW PRIORITY
- refactor duplicate code in PlateChargeMeterNode, StoredEnergyMeterNode
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- delete DeveloperControlPanel if it's no longer used

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH
- how is E-field detector sum vector computed outside the capacitor?
- all E-field detector vectors have same sign, so why does dielectric vector point in opposite direction?
- do E-field detector vectors with positive sign point up or down?
- do E-field detector values have a sign, or are they absolute values?
- what is the desired layout of the vector area in the E-field detector? does it work with tiny vectors?
- what is the E-field detector supposed to do inside the battery? wires?

DESIGN ISSUES
- is range of E-field is too large to make E-Field Detector vector length vary proportionally?

HIGH PRIORITY
- i18n of vector labels in E-field detector
- snapshot of design doc in SVN, for working offline
- decide whether to use Property<T> for EFieldDetector
- implement BatteryCapacitorCircuit.get*At(Point3D) methods
- vectors in field detector
- make "Show Values" its own PSwing so that it will always be at lower-left of field detector 
- simplified field detector for Introduction tab (hide vector check boxes, show only Sum)
- add geometry of wires to model
- add geometry of battery to model
- field detector body jerks up to upper-left of play area sometimes when dragging on a PSwing, general PSwing bug?
- rotate field detector probe by -mvt.getYaw(), handle wire connection
- get voltmeter and E-field detector working without 3D perspective, then work on 3D
- BatteryCapacitorCircuitChangeListeners is inefficient/incomplete/incorrect, collapse to ChangeListener?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- spacing change between charge pairs is very small with battery, because battery range is so small compared to sim max
- dynamic clipping planes for meter probes
- collision detection of probes with battery and plates (OK to pass through wires and dielectric)
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab

LOW PRIORITY
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH
SHRINK VECTOR DISPLAY AREA WIDTH - should simplified field detector have a different layout, optimized for what it shows? (Plate vector centered, narrower vector display area, Show Values checkbox below vectors?)
PLUS AND MINUS, MODEL DIAMETER OF TERMINALS - should the battery geometry model include the + terminal? is 2D plane sufficient?
DO NOTHING - what to do when detector probe moves to other side of detector body, should connecting wire switch sides?
PUNT - zooming grid lines in E-Field Detector has the same scale issue as the vectors
NP WILL THINK ABOUT IT, BUT MAYBE WE DON"T NEED THIS FEATURE - "Remove Wires" is a bad choice of words in Multiple Capacitors tab
NP WILL THINK ABOUT IT, MAYBE TOO MUCH - are we including "Field Lines" feature in Multiple Capacitors tab?
NP WILL THINK ABOUT IT, MAYBE TOO MUCH- are we including "Field Detector" feature in Multiple Capacitors tab?
NP WILL REVIEW MULTI TAB AND SEE WHICH FEATURES SHOULD GO AWAY
YES - when you remove wires from a circuit with 2 parallel capacitors, are they then in series?
NOTHING UNTIL YOU LET GO OF CAPACTIOR - what do views (bar meters, E-feild detector, voltmeter, plate charge, field lines) look like while dragging capacitors to building circuits?
- instead of "Choose Arrangement" dialog, why not have 3 places to drop 3rd capacitor?
- building circuits is going to be expensive to implement and (I predict) confusing to use, would like to see this tested on with mockups
- what happens when meters are in the way while building circuits?

DESIGN ISSUES
- spacing change between charge pairs is very small with battery, because battery range is so small compared to sim max

HIGH PRIORITY
- add geometry of wires to model
- add geometry of probes to model
- get voltmeter and E-field detector working without 3D perspective, then work on 3D
- BatteryCapacitorCircuitChangeListeners is inefficient/incomplete/incorrect, collapse to ChangeListener?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- decide whether to use Property<T> (currently used in: EFieldDetector, World)
- dynamic clipping planes for meter probes
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab

LOW PRIORITY
- initial layout of E-field detector is incorrect if Vector2DNode has zero magnitude (see WORKAROUND in EFieldDetectorView)
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons

GENERAL BUGS
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts
- #XXXX, dragging is broken for PSwing nodes

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

TODO list for capacitor-lab

HIGH PRIORITY
- fix position of plate area drag handle in DielectricCanvas.updatePlateAreaDragHandle
- utilities for computing important 2D points on capacitor's pseudo-3D geometry (for layout, interactivity, and connecting things)
- direct manipulation of plate size, plate separation, dielectric offset
- blue arrow and glowing sphere to represent current flow

MEDUIUM PRIORITY

LOW PRIORITY

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

TODO list for capacitor-lab

HIGH PRIORITY
- bug: in "excess charge" view, dielectric should have the same or fewer charges along the edge as there are along the edge of the plates
- change request: make capacitance slider snap to nearest 0.1 (what to do while dragging? show 2 decimal places and snap on release?)
- change zoom buttons to ButtonNode, EFieldDetectorBodyNode.ZoomPanel to PNode
- bug: things at the bottom of the play area are cut off when main frame is height is reduced

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- lots of duplicate code in AbstractCircuit subclasses
- factor duplicate code into canvas base class (CLCanvas?)
- factor duplicate code into model base class (CLModel?)
- add "circuit selection" screenshots to design doc, with verbage

LOW PRIORITY
- move shape creation out of Wire and into WireNode (via WireShapeFactory) to be consistent with pattern used elsewhere
- fudging of wire segment endpoints should be handled in view based on stroke, not in model
- Win: need some space between dielectric material combo box and separator below it
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- remove unused code

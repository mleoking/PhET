TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

NOAH P ACTION ITEMS
- new E-Field Detector probe, with crosshairs that are visible on dense E-Field
- labels for "Plate Charge" check box, "Plate Charge (top)" meter, and "Plate Charge (top)" slider
- review Multiple Capacitors tab design and decide which features are unnecessary (Remove Wires, E-Field Lines, E-Field Detector)
- consider doing mockup tests of circuit construction, due to the cost and potential confusion of this feature

DESIGN ISSUES
- what happens when meters are in the way while building circuits?

HIGH PRIORITY
- move shape stuff out of Wire and into WireShapeFactory, to be consistent with all other patterns
- hack in BottomWire.createShape
- E-field detector for Intro tab: shrink width of vector display area, horizontally center Plate vector
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- regression test to see what's broken
- test for colorblind issues

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- generalize BatteryCapacitorCircuit to handle multiple capacitors and wires
- more general way to create Wire model elements, subclasses like TopWire and BottomWire are not scalable
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- do initial implementation of Multiple Capacitors tab with radio buttons for selecting completed circuits
- add circuit construction to Multiple Capacitors tab after everything else is working

LOW PRIORITY
- convert BatteryCapacitorCircuit to Property<T>, pre-computing all model values?
- only update things that are visible, do this in the model wherever possible by observing visibleProperty
- add meter body bounds to model so we can keep entire meter body constrained to world bounds when dragging
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- remove unused model code?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- battery and positive terminal shapes should be cylinders (but rectangles is good enough)
- round the ends of wires
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look

GENERAL BUGS
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts
- #2557, dragging is broken for PSwing nodes on Mac

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils
- ShapeUtils
- Dimension3D

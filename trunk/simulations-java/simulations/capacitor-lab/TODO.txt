TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

Oct 9 - complete "as much as possible" per Kathy P. for Hisham

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

DESIGN ISSUES
- use CCK CapacitorNode line 270-230 for charge layout algorithm
- range of plate charge is too large to make plate charges vary proportionally
- range of dielectric charge is too large to make dielectric charges vary proportionally (all + excess)
- range of field is too large to make number of field lines vary proportionally
- range of field is too large to make Field Detector vector length vary proportionally
- no visual cues to indicate 3D location of Field Detector probe 
- no visual cues to indicate 3D location of Voltmeter probes

HIGH PRIORITY
- when "Remove Wires" is pressed, set Plate Charge control to the current plate charge with the battery connected
- charge on plates (see notes)
- charge and excess charge on dielectric (see notes)
- Field Detector
- field lines (with fake curvature?)
- add cables and drag behavior to voltmeter, see CCK's VoltmeterNode
- voltmeter notifiers for moving probes or meter body
- subclass of voltmeter that is specific to this sim, knows about model

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- utilities for computing important 2D points on capacitor's pseudo-3D geometry (for layout, interactivity, and connecting things)
- combine plate charge meter and slider into one thing?
- use air as the dielectric material in Introduction module
- make air dielectric invisible
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- refactor duplicate code in *DragHandleNode
- should Reset All reset default locations for meters?
- specify default locations for meters in model coordinates

LOW PRIORITY
- use phetcommon mvt
- don't allow bar meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- edges where dielectric and bottom plate meet don't match up perfectly
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils
- GridPanel
- FadeOutActivity

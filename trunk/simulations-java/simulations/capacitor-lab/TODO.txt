TODO list for capacitor-lab

HIGH PRIORITY
- bug: in "excess charge" view, dielectric should have the same or fewer charges along the edge as there are along the edge of the plates

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- lots of duplicate code in AbstractCircuit subclasses
- factor duplicate code into canvas base class (CLCanvas?)
- factor duplicate code into model base class (CLModel?)
- document model.circuit package
- create implementation notes document

LOW PRIORITY
- move shape creation out of Wire and into WireNode (via WireShapeFactory) to be consistent with pattern used elsewhere
- fudging of wire segment endpoints should be handled in view based on stroke, not in model
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- remove unused code

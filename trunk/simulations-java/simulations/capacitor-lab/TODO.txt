TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

Oct 9 - complete "as much as possible" per Kathy P. for Hisham

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

DESIGN ISSUES
- is range of E-field is too large to make E-Field Detector vector length vary proportionally?

HIGH PRIORITY
- get voltmeter and E-field detector working without 3D perspective, then work on 3D
- BatteryCapacitorCircuitChangeListeners is inefficient/incomplete/incorrect

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- spacing change between charge pairs is very small with battery, because battery range is so small compared to sim max
- dynamic clipping planes for meter probes
- collision detection of probes with battery and plates (OK to pass through wires and dielectric)
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab

LOW PRIORITY
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- only update meters when they are visible
- edges where dielectric and bottom plate meet don't match up perfectly
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON

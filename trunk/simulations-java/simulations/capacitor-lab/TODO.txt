TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

HIGH PRIORITY
- make capacitance slider snap to nearest 0.1 (what to do while dragging? show 2 decimal places and snap on release?)
- #2903, E-field default scale and autoscaling
- lots of duplicate code in AbstractCircuit subclasses
- cleanup maximums used in DielectricCanvas and MultipleCapacitorsCanvas

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- factor duplicate code into canvas base class (CLCanvas?)
- factor duplicate code into model base class (CLModel?)
- add "circuit selection" screenshots to design doc, with verbage

LOW PRIORITY
- move shape creation out of Wire and into WireNode (via WireShapeFactory) to be consistent with pattern used elsewhere
- fudging of wire segment endpoints should be handled in view based on stroke, not in model
- delete empty packages
- Win: need some space between dielectric material combo box and separator below it
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- remove unused code

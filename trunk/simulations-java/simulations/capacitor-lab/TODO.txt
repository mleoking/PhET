TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

NOAH P ACTION ITEMS
- consider doing mockup tests of circuit construction, due to the cost and potential confusion of this feature
- review Multiple Capacitors tab design and decide which features are unnecessary (Remove Wires, E-Field Lines, E-Field Detector)
- need a different name for "Remove Wires" in Multiple Capacitors tab

DESIGN ISSUES
- what happens when meters are in the way while building circuits?

HIGH PRIORITY
- start E-Field Detector zoom level at max magnification, appropriate for battery
- make only negative charges move in dielectric "Show all charges" view
- review startup defaults with Noah
- bug: changing dielectric constant doesn't change E-field view when battery is disconnected
- regression test to see what's broken
- move shape stuff out of Wire and into WireShapeFactory, to be consistent with all other patterns
- better encapsulation of ShapeFactory approach to measurement, move out of model and into a strategy pattern
- hack in BottomWire.createShape

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- convert CapacitorNode to Property<T>
- convert BatteryCapacitorCircuit to Property<T>, BatteryCapacitorCircuitChangeListeners is inefficient/incomplete/incorrect
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- E-field detector for Intro tab: shrink width of vector display area, horizontally center Plate vector
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- do initial implementation of Multiple Capacitors tab with radio buttons for selecting completed circuits
- add circuit construction to Multiple Capacitors tab after everything else is working

LOW PRIORITY
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the ends of wires
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- battery and positive terminal shapes should be cylinders (but rectangles is good enough)

GENERAL BUGS
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts
- #2557, dragging is broken for PSwing nodes on Mac

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils
- ShapeUtils
- Dimension3D

TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH
- colorblind issues?

NOAH P ACTION ITEMS
- need a different check box and label for "Plate Charge" and "Plate Charge (top)" meter, not appropriate in Multiple Capacitors
- review Multiple Capacitors tab design and decide which features are unnecessary (Remove Wires, E-Field Lines, E-Field Detector)
- consider doing mockup tests of circuit construction, due to the cost and potential confusion of this feature

DESIGN ISSUES
- what happens when meters are in the way while building circuits?
- charge spacing moves too quickly when voltage gets close to zero due to 1/n scaling algorithm

HIGH PRIORITY
- Plate Charge meter is initialized to incorrect value at startup
- Stored Energy meter is initialized to incorrect value at startup
- move shape stuff out of Wire and into WireShapeFactory, to be consistent with all other patterns
- hack in BottomWire.createShape
- E-field detector for Intro tab: shrink width of vector display area, horizontally center Plate vector
- get new E-field probe image, crosshairs need to be visible on a dense E-Field
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- regression test to see what's broken

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- generalize BatteryCapacitorCircuit to handle multiple capacitors and wires
- more general way to create Wire model elements, subclasses like TopWire and BottomWire are not scalable
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- do initial implementation of Multiple Capacitors tab with radio buttons for selecting completed circuits
- add circuit construction to Multiple Capacitors tab after everything else is working

LOW PRIORITY
- convert BatteryCapacitorCircuit to Property<T>?
- only update things that are visible, do this in the model wherever possible by observing visibleProperty
- add meter body bounds to model
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the ends of wires
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- battery and positive terminal shapes should be cylinders (but rectangles is good enough)

GENERAL BUGS
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts
- #2557, dragging is broken for PSwing nodes on Mac

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils
- ShapeUtils
- Dimension3D

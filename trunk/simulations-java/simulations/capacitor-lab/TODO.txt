TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

DESIGN ISSUES
- do interviews with mockups of circuit construction feature, due to cost and potential issues
- what happens when meters are in the way in Multiple Capacitors tab?

HIGH PRIORITY
- #2903, E-field default scale and autoscaling
- lots of duplicate code in AbstractCircuit subclasses
- cleanup model and view constants (some in CLConstants, some in MultipleCapacitorsModel)
- cleanup maximums used in DielectricCanvas and MultipleCapacitorsCanvas
- "Total Capacitance" for capacitance meter?
- "Stored Charge" for charge meter?

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- use shorter vertical wires in parallel circuits, to make more space for meters
- factor duplicate code into canvas base class (CLCanvas?)
- factor duplicate code into model base class (CLModel?)
- account for capacitance slider i18n when computing horizontal spacing of capacitors

LOW PRIORITY
- move shape creation out of Wire and into WireNode (via WireShapeFactory) to be consistent with pattern used elsewhere
- delete empty packages
- would it be OK to have the dielectric fully inserted (offset=0) in the Intro tab?
- Win: need some space between dielectric material combo box and separator below it
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- remove unused code

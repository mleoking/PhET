TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH
- should you be able to touch the bottom plate with a voltmeter probe through the transparent dielectric?
- when should the dielectric be transparent?
- any special consideration with the glass dielectric, which is always transparent?
- should be put a dashed box around the E-field measurement shape?

NOAH P ACTION ITEMS
- consider doing mockup tests of circuit construction, due to the cost and potential confusion of this feature
- review Multiple Capacitors tab design and decide which features are unnecessary (Remove Wires, E-Field Lines, E-Field Detector)
- need a different name for "Remove Wires" in Multiple Capacitors tab

DESIGN ISSUES
- what happens when meters are in the way while building circuits?
- should only the negative dielectric charges move in the "Show all charges" view?

HIGH PRIORITY
- better encapsulation of measuring strategy based on 2D projection of Shapes
- address stroke issue in WireShapeFactory.createSegmentShape
- WireNode gets shapes from Wire, which has a Shape property, this pattern is different
- hack in BottomWire

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- E-field detector for Intro tab: shrink width of vector display area, horizontally center Plate vector
- BatteryCapacitorCircuitChangeListeners is inefficient/incomplete/incorrect, collapse to ChangeListener?
- decide whether to use Property<T> or EventListener
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- do initial implementation of Multiple Capacitors tab with radio buttons for selecting completed circuits
- add circuit construction to Multiple Capacitors tab after everything else is working

LOW PRIORITY
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the ends of wires
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons

GENERAL BUGS
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts
- #2557, dragging is broken for PSwing nodes on Mac

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

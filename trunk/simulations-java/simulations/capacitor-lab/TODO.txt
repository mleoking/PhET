TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

Oct 9 - complete "as much as possible" per Kathy P. for Hisham

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

DESIGN ISSUES
- range of dielectric charge is too large to make dielectric charges vary proportionally (all + excess)
- range of field is too large to make number of field lines vary proportionally
- range of field is too large to make Field Detector vector length vary proportionally
- no visual cues to indicate 3D location of Field Detector probe 
- no visual cues to indicate 3D location of Voltmeter probes

HIGH PRIORITY
- E-field lines shift around slightly when density isn't changing (drag battery slider to reproduce)
- no change in E-field density when changing battery voltage because of order-of-magnitude issues
- E-field lines moves around when going from 2x2 to 3x3 grid, density is the same, but looks odd
- grid size strategy doesn't work for small numbers of plate charges
- charge and excess charge on dielectric (see notes)
- field lines (with fake curvature?)
- Introduction tab, use air as the dielectric material
- Reset All feature

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- TestPlateChargeLayout & PlateChargesNode: tall narrow plate results in too many charges, alpha too large?
- PlateChargeNode: no charges sometimes shown when air contact area is small
- how to handle look for probes being inside, outside, or partially inside the dielectric
- collision detection of probes with battery and plates (OK to pass through wires and dielectric)
- Field Detector
- add cables and drag behavior to voltmeter, see CCK's VoltmeterNode
- voltmeter notifiers for moving probes or meter body
- subclass of voltmeter that is specific to this sim, knows about model
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- refactor duplicate code in *DragHandleNode
- should Reset All reset default locations for meters?
- specify default locations for meters in model coordinates

LOW PRIORITY
- Save/Load feature?
- use phetcommon mvt
- don't allow bar meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- edges where dielectric and bottom plate meet don't match up perfectly
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils
- GridPanel
- FadeOutActivity

TODO list for capacitor-lab

HIGH PRIORITY
- make dielectric draggable by grabbing it
- solve coordinate frame conversion issues for drag handles
- fix behavior of plate size drag handle, whose axis is on the diagonal of the top plate (should drag point be on a line perpendicular to this axis?)
- utilities for computing important 2D points on capacitor's pseudo-3D geometry (for layout, interactivity, and connecting things)
- blue arrow and glowing sphere to represent current flow
- charge and excess charge on plates (see notes)
- charge and excess charge on dielectric (see notes)

MEDUIUM PRIORITY

LOW PRIORITY
- delete DeveloperControlPanel if it's no longer used

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

DESIGN ISSUES
- labels for "Plate Charge" check box, "Plate Charge (top)" meter, and "Plate Charge (top)" slider
- do interviews with mockups of circuit construction feature, due to cost and potential issues
- what happens when meters are in the way while building circuits?

MULTIPLE CAPACITORS REQUIREMENTS
- simplified capacitors with fixed area and variable capacitance, separation changes with capacitance
- min/max of capacitance slider varies capacitance by 3x (choose min/max to look good)
- capacitance meter shows total capacitance for the circuit (label "Total Capacitance"?)
- charge meter shows total charge stored for the circuit (label "Total Charge Stored"?)
- no dielectric (air)
- show charge on plates
- show E-field lines
- current indicators near battery poles (like in other tabs)

HIGH PRIORITY
- plate voltage doesn't make sense for C2 in Combination1Circuit
- add support for wires in getVoltageAt for all AbstractCircuit subclasses
- delete ICapacitor, if Capacitor reuse in Multi-Cap works out
- E-Field and Voltage shape creation
- move shape creation out of Wire and into WireNode (via WireShapeFactory) to be consistent with pattern used elsewhere
- hack in createShape of some wire subclasses
- duplicate code in AbstractCircuit subclasses
- change meter and check box labels in Multiple Capacitors tab
- create a PNode subclass for all circuit-related nodes in DielectricCanvas
- remove voltage from Wire model?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- horizontal top wire in Combination1Circuit is too low, should look like Combination2Circuit
- cleanup methods needed where anonymous observers/listeners are added in constructors
- convert DielectricMaterialControl to use PropertyRadioButton and Property<DielectricMaterial> dielectricMaterial
- convert DielectricConstantControl to use Property<Double> dielectricConstant
- convert VoltageSliderNode to use Property<Double> voltage
- convert PlateChargeControlNode to use Property<Double> disconnectedPlateCharge
- convert BatteryConnectionButtonNode to use Property<Boolean> batteryConnected
- convert CurrentIndicatorNode to observer of Property<Double> currentAmplitude
- merge MultipleCapacitorsModule/Model/Canvas/ControlPanel into DielectricModule/Model/Canvas/ControlPanel
- add setCircuit methods to all persistent controls
- add editable mantissa textfield to capacitance control

LOW PRIORITY
- would it be OK to have the dielectric fully inserted (offset=0) in the Intro tab?
- Win: need some space between dielectric material combo box and separator below it
- add circuit construction to Multiple Capacitors tab?
- small (100mm^2) capacitor plates look like they are at a 46-degree yaw, instead of 45-degree
- only update things that are visible, do this in the model wherever possible by observing visibleProperty
- add meter body bounds to model so we can keep entire meter body constrained to world bounds when dragging
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- remove unused model code?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons

GENERAL BUGS
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts
- #2557, dragging is broken for PSwing nodes on Mac

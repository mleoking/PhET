TODO list for capacitor-lab

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

HIGH PRIORITY
- fix plate area drag handle to take into account the pseudo-3D perspective (foreshortening and yaw)
- use phetcommon mvt
- autoscale button with tooltip on Charge, Energy, Capacitance meters, make max value text blink red
- add cables and drag behavior to voltmeter, see CCK's VoltmeterNode
- voltmeter notifiers for moving probes or meter body
- subclass of voltmeter that is specific to this sim, knows about model
- utilities for computing important 2D points on capacitor's pseudo-3D geometry (for layout, interactivity, and connecting things)
- blue arrow and glowing sphere to represent dV/dt
- charge and excess charge on plates (see notes)
- charge and excess charge on dielectric (see notes)
- field meter with dashed line around "detecting plane"

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- combine plate charge meter and slider into one thing?
- derive PlateChargeMeterNode.MAX_EXPONENT and PlateChargeControlNode.VALUE_EXPONENT
- use air as the dielectric material in Introduction module
- make air dielectric invisible
- fake curvature in E-field?
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- refactor duplicate code in *DragHandleNode

LOW PRIORITY
- edges where dielectric and bottom plate meet don't match up perfectly
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils
- GridPanel

TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

DESIGN ISSUES
- spacing change between charge pairs is very small with battery, because battery range is so small compared to sim max
- what to do when detector probe moves to other side of detector body, should connecting wire switch sides?
- should simplified field detector have a different layout, optimized for what it shows? (Plate vector centered, narrower vector display area, Show Values checkbox below vectors?)

HIGH PRIORITY
- add auto-zoom button to E-field detector
- decide whether to use Property<T> for EFieldDetector
- add geometry of wires to model
- add geometry of battery to model
- field detector body jerks up to upper-left of play area sometimes when dragging on a PSwing, general PSwing bug?
- rotate field detector probe by -mvt.getYaw(), handle wire connection
- get voltmeter and E-field detector working without 3D perspective, then work on 3D
- BatteryCapacitorCircuitChangeListeners is inefficient/incomplete/incorrect, collapse to ChangeListener?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- dynamic clipping planes for meter probes
- collision detection of probes with battery and plates (OK to pass through wires and dielectric)
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab

LOW PRIORITY
- initial layout is incorrect if it involves a Vector2DNode with zero magnitude (see WORKAROUND in EFieldDetectorView)
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

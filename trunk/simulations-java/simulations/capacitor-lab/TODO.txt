TODO list for capacitor-lab

DEADLINES

QUESTIONS FOR NOAH

NOAH P ACTION ITEMS
- consider doing mockup tests of circuit construction, due to the cost and potential confusion of this feature
- review Multiple Capacitors tab design and decide which features are unnecessary (Remove Wires, E-Field Lines, E-Field Detector)
- need a different name for "Remove Wires" in Multiple Capacitors tab

DESIGN ISSUES
- spacing change between charge pairs is very small with battery, because battery range is so small compared to sim max
- what happens when meters are in the way while building circuits?

HIGH PRIORITY
- add geometry of wires to model
- add geometry of probes to model
- add geometry of battery terminals (+ and -) to model
- implement BatteryCapacitorCircuit.getVoltageBetween(Point2D,Point2D)
- dynamic clipping planes for meter probes
- E-field detector for Intro tab: shrink width of vector display area, horizontally center Plate vector
- show "?" in voltmeter when probes are not connected to circuit

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- BatteryCapacitorCircuitChangeListeners is inefficient/incomplete/incorrect, collapse to ChangeListener?
- decide whether to use Property<T> (currently used in: EFieldDetector, World)
- all features in Multiple Capacitors tab
- do initial implementation of Multiple Capacitors tab with radio buttons for selecting completed circuits
- add circuit construction to Multiple Capacitors tab after everything else is working

LOW PRIORITY
- initial layout of E-field detector is incorrect if Vector2DNode has zero magnitude (see WORKAROUND in EFieldDetectorView)
- clean up CCKStrategyWithRounding
- gradient paint on plate top surfaces (not on edges)
- round the end of the wire that connects to the top plate
- use a gradient paint for wires to give them a 3D look
- use of Polarity enum is a little incorrect, it's not really polarity
- some model code is unused, remove it?

LOWEST PRIORITY
- don't allow meters to be dragged by buttons, this prevents ability to roll off buttons

GENERAL BUGS
- #2521, dragging HTMLNode leaves artifacts
- #2557, dragging is broken for PSwing nodes on Mac

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON
- PolygonUtils

> Changed velocity color to green
> Changed acceleration color to pink
> Changed position to blue
> Changed line trace to have same color as position
> Added a dot to the center of the Remote Control
> Made ladybug arrow vectors 1/4 as wide
> Removed clock from RecordingControl
> Fixed trace to only show last 30 seconds
> Increased play area acceleration vector length (by factor of 1.2)
> Decreased play area velocity vector length (multiplied by 0.55)
> Disabled motions during playback
> (add developer control for investigation) Should be able to set a value to the Remote Control, and have it remain even after releasing mouse button.
> (add dev control) Remote Control should act as an indicator as well as controller
> Added dev control for timeline length
> Added developer controls to simulate options for returning to record mode
> Improved performance during record, motion is much smoother
> Made aspect ratio square

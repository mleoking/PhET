> Moved the expression evaluator dialog to the bottom right of the parent window.  This gets it out of the way of other readouts and controls, and prevents a scenario that crashes the sim, resolves #2670
Make the simulation go into position driven mode when the go button is pressed.  Otherwise, it could use constant velocity or constant acceleration instead of the expression
> Fixed: the play button in the expression evaluator only shows sometimes, resolves #2892
> Added credits, resolves #2719

# 1.28.04 (42265) Jul 14, 2010
Fixed velocity and acceleration vector arrows to always be the same width independent of magnitude
# 1.28.03 (42182) Jul 11, 2010
Added axis rotation animation when reversing the x axis
Fixed: Vertical axis labels should have tick marks
Added 5 pixels at the top of the play area in the charting module instead of having everything right at y=0
Added a double-triangle icon to the left of the vertical zoom buttons
Fixed: Chart series curves prevent grabbing of the chart playback cursor
Added a check box for enabling/disabling sound
Added reset for chart maximized/minimized and zoom settings
Fixed reset all for charts minimize/maximize
Added domain tick labels in the charts
Fixed: Horizontal zoom will be available on the bottom chart only, near the time axis, and vertical zoom buttons will be near the top of each chart
Added some padding insets to the left and bottom of the simulation panel in the chart module
Only show the domain axis labels for the bottom chart
Horizontal zoom is able to zoom in to 2.0 seconds
Vertical zoom works as a scale factor, not as an addition term
Made the y=0 grid line thicker and darker
Made walls twice as thick
Fixed: Vectors do not update when reversing the x-axis
Added audio during crashes with wall
Added a time readout
Fixed: Vectors should have same thickness as in original moving man
Fixed: Vectors should be located at character's feet
Fixed: Vectors should be semitransparent
Fixed: Acceleration should be green, not magenta
Fixed: Acceleration vector scale should be much larger so that setting a value on the acceleration slider is visible in the play area vector
Fixed: Ticks and labels on charts are intercepting events.
Added a tick mark to the middle of horizontal sliders
# 1.28.02 (42016) Jun 30, 2010
Internationalized strings
Switched to m/s^2 to support pre-existing translations specified as html.
Fixed: When you resize the "graph playback cursor" doesn't redraw itself until you grab it or start playing it
Added text for chart maximize buttons
Fixed: Axes alignment is broken on horizontal zoom
Changed the layout of charts so that they use all available vertical space.
Increased font size for readouts in chart tab
Factored out creation of chart slider node thumbnails
Factored out cursor usage
Moved charts to common code
# 1.28.01 (41829) Jun 21, 2010
Fixed: Axis rotation fails for charts tab
Added expression evaluation dialog
Added menu item to flip x-axis
Refactoring and documentation for MovingManState and related classes.
# 0.00.05 (41764) Jun 17, 2010
Fixed: Chart cursor goes off chart when zoomed in
Fixed: zoom button should have plus on top and right
Added tree and house graphics
# 0.00.04 (41679) Jun 14, 2010
Fixed: Sim should start up in record mode instead of playback
Fixed: Reset all should switch to record mode
Fixed: Reset all should restore playback speed to 1.0
Fixed record and playback so that chart readouts match up with the chart curve graphics
Made it so that the chart serieses are sampled at the same time, so that derivatives don't lag
# 0.00.03 (41640) Jun 14, 2010
Improved the visibility of the in-chart cursor node
Added handling for starting recording halfway through playback
Fixed: Horizontal line drawn when clearing velocity and acceleration curves
Fixed: Chart series needs to be re-transformed on component resize event
Added horizontal zoom buttons
Improvements for vertical zoom buttons
Update charts and indicator arrows when zoom changes
Added initial version of vertical zoom buttons
Fixed: Play area arrows look incorrect at small magnitudes
Hide the blue timeline bar when chart playback cursor can be used instead
Added a deceleration spike when accelerating into a wall
Fixed: Clicking on a slider with value 10000+ causes blocky areas to turn white, transform or NaN exception?
Aligned chart go button with right edge of other controls instead of centered
Switched out-of-range slider indication from thumb rotation to thumb transparency
Switched play area slider thumbs from arrows to bars
Centered play area in introduction control panel
Fixed: Chart control "go" button should have correct behavior during playback (instead of just recording)
Fixed: Chart control "go" button should also behave as a pause button instead of disappearing.
record-and-playback: 6/13/2010 Layout improvements for RecordAndPlaybackControlPanel
Added a reset all button

Fixed: Chart cursor node should disappear when chart minimized
Added out-of-range sliders for vertical sliders (with thumb rotation) on chart tab
Fixed a bug in the man drag handler
Fixed: Stop recording data after 20 seconds to avoid leaking
Fixed: Dragging man should be absolute, not relative, so the mouse doesn't get offset after wall collision
# 0.00.01 (41532) Jun 10, 2010
Fixed: If the user sets acceleration and velocity then presses go, should switch to acceleration mode so the acceleration is not overwritten (and same for velocity)
Added slider arrow rotation to indicate value-out-of-slider-range, while still enabling control over the values
Text-box improvements, accept value on focus lost and select all on focus gained so the user doesn't have to delete text before typing a new value
Fixed layout so that charts resize to take up additional space when window resized
Updated slider ranges on intro panel so that motion is constrained to a reasonable speed
Added "Show vector" checkboxes to chart tab

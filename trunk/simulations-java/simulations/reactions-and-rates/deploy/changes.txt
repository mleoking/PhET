7-19-2007: Fixed a bug that caused an exception when changing molecules.  This was causing the following bug report:
            1.	The shooter doesn’t work if you change the type of reaction until you hit Pause then Play, but the particle is given a relative amount of energy based on how much you moved the mouse.

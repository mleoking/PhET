All units are in SI unless stated otherwise in the code.

There are several image sequences that are loaded with dynamically created strings--hence the images will appear unused in the ForcesAndMotionBasicsResources.java file,
even though the images are used.

Tab 1: Tug of War

The most important class for this tab is TugOfWarCanvas.  All of the physics and model is implemented in this class, because it is very simple.
Reset is implemented by creating a new canvas and discarding the old one.

Tab 2: Motion

Tabs 2-3 are all implemented using the same codebase in the "motion" package, with a boolean setting to indicate whether it is the 2nd tab or 3rd tab.
Reset is implemented by creating a new canvas and discarding the old one.

Tab 3: Friction

See above.

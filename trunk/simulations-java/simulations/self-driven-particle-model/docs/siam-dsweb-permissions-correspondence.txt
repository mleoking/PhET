Dear James and Sam,

This sounds fine with me, but I am putting you in touch with each other
on this issue, since I am not sure whether there are any issues of
concern for SIAM.

Best,
Evelyn

Evelyn,

My name is Sam Reid, I have written 1-D Cellular Automata and
Self-Driven Particle Model tutorials for DSWeb.  I've been working with
a physics education group called PhET at the University of Colorado:

http://phet.colorado.edu/

You have previously given PhET permission to co-host the Self-Driven
Particle Model tutorial, as long as we provide credits and links to
DSWeb.
However, we have recently received (and verified) bug reports that the
tutorial doesn't launch correctly under the new Java 6.0.  How would you
and DSWeb feel about giving PhET permission to add SDPM tutorial source
code to our codebase?  This will make it easier for us to make this (and
possibly
future) bug fixes.

PhET simulations are open-source; how would you feel about adding our
open-source license to the SDPM tutorial?  This will make it possible
for others to inspect, extend and improve this software.

Thanks,

Sam Reid

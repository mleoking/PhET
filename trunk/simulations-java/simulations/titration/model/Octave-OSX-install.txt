Installing Octave and Gnuplot on OSX
(from http://www.island94.org/2007/09/setting-up-octave-and-gnuplot-on-osx/)

1. Download the Octave and Gnuplot binaries for OSX from 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/
   This downloads a dmg (disk image).

2. Install Octave and Gnuplot (Gnuplot is in the Extras folder) by 
   dragging them to /Applications.  Note that X11 is required for Gnuplot.

3. Create a symlink that Octave is supposed to create but doesn't:
   sudo ln -s /Applications/GnuPlot.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gnuplot /usr/bin/gnuplot

4. Download and install Aquaterm, which renders Gnuplot graphs:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/aquaterm/

5. Run Gnuplot and set the renderer to "terminal aqua" (if it isn't already).

6. Test Octave:

   x = linspace( -pi, pi, 100 );
   y = sin( x );
   plot( x, y );

Graphing Absolute Value (design notes)

equation form: y = a|x - h| + k

From http://www.sparknotes.com/math/algebra2/specialgraphs/section4.rhtml:
In general, the graph of the absolute value function f(x) = a|x - h| + k is a "V" with vertex (h, k),
slope m = a on the right side of the vertex ( x > h ) and slope m = - a on the left side of the vertex ( x < h ).
The graph of f(x) = -a|x - h| + k is an upside-down "V" with vertex (h, k), slope m = -a for x > h
and slope m = a for x < h.

Equals (=) relational operator only, no inequalities.

On graph:
- (h,k) manipulator
- rise/run (2 mirror image points, linked)
- rise/run brackets on both
- 2 point tools
- label lines centered below V (V points at equation)

check box: y = |x|
check box: y = -|x|
check box: Slope
turn absolute value operator on/off? (when off, need to write in point-slope form)

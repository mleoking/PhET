Absolute Value sim

equation form: y = a|x - h| + k

From http://www.sparknotes.com/math/algebra2/specialgraphs/section4.rhtml:
In general, the graph of the absolute value function f(x) = a|x - h| + k is a "V" with vertex (h, k),
slope m = a on the right side of the vertex ( x > h ) and slope m = - a on the left side of the vertex ( x < h ).
The graph of f(x) = -a|x - h| + k is an upside-down "V" with vertex (h, k), slope m = -a for x > h
and slope m = a for x < h.

DESIGN

SPINNER IDEAS
- AP's design
- iOS Picker with swipe gesture
- fractions buttons above/below numbers, buttons side-by-side
- small up/down arrows above/below each number

HIGH
- dynamically enable/disable the spinner buttons as the range changes
- rename first 2 tabs: Slope-Intercept, Point-Slope
- don't allow rise/run=0/0, snap rise above or below the intercept on endDrag

MEDIUM
- max width of spinners needs to be based the length of the axis ranges, not the min/max values
- clean up standard line icons (no equation on line, shorter line)
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SpinnerButtonNode, copied from fractions

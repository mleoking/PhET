TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- if user saves 2 lines with the same reduced form, they will see only 1 saved line (actually 2 identical lines on top of each other)
- will constraints on dragging manipulators be confusing? Eg, with b=-2, m can't be dragged higher than y=8
- Save Line button is enabled when interactive equation changes, but the reduced form of the line may be the same

HIGH
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- don't show rise/run brackets for zero values
- when equation is minimized, equation on graphed line should be hidden, not the entire line

MEDIUM
- improve layout of equation, try spinners in various layouts and locations
- try dynamically changing the rise/run/intercept constraints to keep line manipulators on the grid
- clean up standard line icons (no equation on line, shorter line)
- try iOS Picker for changing numbers in equation

LOW
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- create spinner buttons programmatically to match colors
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SpinnerButtonNode, copied from fractions

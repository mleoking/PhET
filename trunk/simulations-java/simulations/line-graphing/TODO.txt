TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")

HIGH
- rewrite demo challenge
- move some of the fields and responsibilities in LineGameModel into challenges
- create additional game challenges

MEDIUM
- verify that game "reward" animation is running only when visible

LOW

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

GAME CHALLENGES
Do each of these for "Graph the Line" and "Make the Equation"
- slope-intercept form + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + slope variable (plot intercept)
- slope-intercept form + slope variable + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + 2 point manipulators
- point-slope form + point variable
- point-slope form + slope variable (plot point)
- point-slope form + slope variable + point variable
- point-slope form + 2 point manipulators

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

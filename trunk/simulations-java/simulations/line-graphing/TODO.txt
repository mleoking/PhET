TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")
- when user fails at a challenge and we show answer, should they be able to change things to experiment further?
- when user fails at "Make the Equation" challenge, we show correct equation. Anything else? Plot incorrect line? Put manipulators on correct/incorrect line? ...

HIGH
- example of each "Make the Equation" game challenge
- in "Show Answer" for "Make the Equation", show the answer as a separate read-only equation below the interactive equation
- random creation of challenges, subject to constraints tbd

MEDIUM
- factor out duplication in ChallengeNode subclasses

LOW

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

GAME CHALLENGES
Do each of these for "Make the Equation"
- slope-intercept form + slope variable (plot intercept)
- slope-intercept form + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + slope variable + intercept variable
- point-slope form + point variable
- point-slope form + slope variable (plot point)
- point-slope form + point variable + slope variable

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- Game

HIGH
- using interactive equation skips over values that would produce slope=0/0, but value in equation isn't updated
- duplication: SlopeInterceptCanvas, PointSlopeCanvas

MEDIUM
- better handling and testing of adjustment to avoid slope=0/0
- when point tool is on a saved line, change the point tool highlighting when the user mouses over the saved line
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode

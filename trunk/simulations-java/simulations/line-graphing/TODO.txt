TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- spinners or pickers for interactive equation? (SlopeInterceptEquationNode or SlopeInterceptEquationNode2)

HIGH
- AP: when the slope manipulator is in the 4th quadrant it appears you can get a "negative" slope displayed on the line even though the actual slope is positive.
- implement Point-Slope tab
- prevent slope=0/0 in the interactive equation by skipping over 0. This also affects dynamic range.

MEDIUM
- replace shaped-based picker buttons with images to be provided by AP
- outlined numbers (OutlinePText) can't be reliably centered in pickers and they are aliased
- when point tool is on a saved line, change the point tool highlighting when the user mouses over the saved line
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

LOW
- equations on lines are sometimes difficult to read when they overlap with other things
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- create spinner buttons programmatically, so they look more like line manipulators

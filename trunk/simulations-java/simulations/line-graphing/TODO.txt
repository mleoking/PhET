TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines, should it be on same end of line as slope manipulator? or in Q1 or Q4 (as is) so that it's close to interactive line?
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")
- navigation game
- sign-off on specification of game levels
- add "Slope" tab for m=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1) ?

HIGH
- Game: "Place 3 Points" challenge
- Game: challenge generation (levels and randomization)

MEDIUM
- add ability to specify alternate title (eg "Set the slope", "Set the y intercept") for challenges
- add support for fractional y-intercept in slope-intercept equations (only when y-intercept is non-interactive)
- add support for mismatching the equation for on the left and right side of GTL and MTE challenges
- move things to EquationNode base class (adding UndefinedSlopeIndicatorNode, creating slope nodes,...)
- sort out duplication in IChallenge and ChallengeNode hierarchies (introducing booleans for what's interactive should collapse a lot of things)

LOW
- review usages of Line.simplified
- repackage, in anticipation of having 3 sims in this project

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS

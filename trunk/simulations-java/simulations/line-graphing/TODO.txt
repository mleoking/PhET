TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels very unbalanced for game challenges, very heavy on the graph side
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines
- names for the 3 sims in this project

HIGH
- rewrite demo challenge
- some of the fields and responsibilities in LineGameModel are challenge specific. Eg, mvt, point tools, whether to maintain a list of lines, etc.
- create additional game challenges

MEDIUM

LOW

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

GAME CHALLENGES
Do each of these for "Graph the Line" and "Make the Equation"
- slope-intercept form + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + slope variable (plot intercept)
- slope-intercept form + slope variable + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + 2 point manipulators
- point-slope form + point variable
- point-slope form + slope variable (plot point)
- point-slope form + slope variable + point variable
- point-slope form + 2 point manipulators

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- RewardNode, copied and adapted from BCE and RPAL
- "game phase" framework
- standardize and move game strings to phetcommon? (Check, Try Again, Show Answer, Next)
- LGCanvas: I've been doing this over and over in sims, create StageCanvas or PhetPCanvasWithStage

TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")
- Game: when user fails at a challenge and we show answer, should they be able to change things to experiment further?
- Game: more challenges?
- Game: rules for generating random challenges and initial guess
- Game: do we need "x=#" equations? hope not...
- Game: Graph the Line: equations are not reduced, I think that's the correct thing to do, but wanted to check. We'll have slopes like -4/-2.
- Game: Make the Equation: when user fails a challenge, we show correct equation. Show anything else? Plot incorrect line? Put manipulators on correct/incorrect line? ...
- Game: Make the Equation: should non-interactive parts of equation be reduced? which parts? how?

HIGH
- allow user to play with challenge after "Show Answer"
- Graph The Line: on "Show Answer", show the equation for incorrect answer, put icons next to equations to indicate correct and incorrect
- change location of slope sign, vertically center it between "=" and fraction division line, add "vertical offset" parameter to constructors
- slope-intercept or point-slope with non-interactive slope: reduce X/1 to X, hide 1/1
- slope-intercept or point-slope with non-interactive slope: align abs values of slopes, place sign to left of rise
- slope-intercept or point-slope with non-interactive slope: hide slope and "x" when slope==0
- point-slope with non-interactive x1: hide x1 if it's zero
- point-slope with non-interactive y1: hide y1 if it's zero
- unify interactive and non-interactive equations (equation factories)
- example of each "Make the Equation" game challenge
- in "Show Answer" for "Make the Equation", show the answer as a separate read-only equation below the interactive equation
- random creation of challenges, subject to constraints tbd

MEDIUM
- factor out duplication in ChallengeNode subclasses

LOW

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

GAME CHALLENGES
Do each of these for "Make the Equation"
- slope-intercept form + slope variable (plot intercept)
- slope-intercept form + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + slope variable + intercept variable
- point-slope form + point variable
- point-slope form + slope variable (plot point)
- point-slope form + point variable + slope variable

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

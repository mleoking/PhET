TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- spinners or pickers for interactive equation? (SlopeInterceptEquationNode or SlopeInterceptEquationNode2)

HIGH
- implement Point-Slope tab

MEDIUM
- replace shaped-based picker buttons with images to be provided by AP
- outlined numbers (OutlineTextNode) in pickers are aliased
- numbers in pickers aren't always centered
- when point tool is on a saved line, change the point tool highlighting when the user mouses over the saved line
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- delete spinner-based equation and associated image files

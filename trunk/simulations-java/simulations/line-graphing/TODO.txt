TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN

HIGH
- Game: generate challenges for levels 4-6
- Game dev: Level 7 = configure your own challenge
- Game: add support for mismatching the line form on the left and right side of GTL and MTE challenges (consult design doc)

MEDIUM
- move duplication in GTL_ChallengeNode, MTE_ChallengeNode and P3P_ChallengeNode into base class ChallengeNode
- could P3P_ChallengeNode be a subclass of GTL_ChallengeNode?
- rise value on slope tool falls off left edge of play area in Point-Slope tab

LOW
- add horizontal space between L and R halves of the play area, where possible
- document CoordinateSpinnerNode constructor
- remove code related to SlopeEquationNode.PUT_UNSIMPLIFIED_SLOPE_ON_SEPARATE_LINE
- order of lines provided to point tool is not related to order of lines rendered on graph, would be nice if they used the same info

LOWEST
- move ownership of mvt from model to view
- Game: for GTE challenge, "Your line" equation shifts up and down when slope changes between fraction and integer
- consider using a subtle background color for buttons (Reset All, Save Line, Erase Lines)
- repackage, in anticipation of having 3 sims in this project

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review (JB)

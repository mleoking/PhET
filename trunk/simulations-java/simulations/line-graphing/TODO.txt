- if "Graph lines" is unchecked, how does this affect controls that deal with lines on graph? are they disabled?

HIGH
- reuse spinner buttons from fractions, see SpinnerButtonNode
- implement SlopeInterceptEquationNode
- direct manipulation of slope and intercept on line
- rise/run brackets

MEDIUM
- show equations on lines
- point tool
- deal with undefined slope in SlopeInterceptLine
- add show/hide button for slope-intercept equation

LOW
- create check box icons

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON

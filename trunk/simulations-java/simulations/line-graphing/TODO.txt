TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN

HIGH
- Game level 4: force inversion of slope in GTL challenge with 2 points
- Game: generate challenges for levels 5-6
- Game dev: Level 7 = configure your own challenge
- Game: add support for mismatching the line form on the left and right side of GTL and MTE challenges (consult design doc)

MEDIUM
- factor out duplication in ChallengeFactory hierarchy when the dust settles

LOW
- remove code related to SlopeEquationNode.PUT_UNSIMPLIFIED_SLOPE_ON_SEPARATE_LINE
- order of lines provided to point tool is not related to order of lines rendered on graph, would be nice if they used the same info

LOWEST
- move ownership of mvt from model to view
- Game: for GTE challenge, "Your line" equation shifts up and down when slope changes between fraction and integer
- consider using a subtle background color for buttons (Reset All, Save Line, Erase Lines)

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- enter a specific challenge

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review (JB)

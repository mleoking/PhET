TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- sign-off on specification of game levels

HIGH
- add support for fractional y-intercept in slope-intercept equations (only when y-intercept is not interactive)
- Game: "Place 3 Points" challenge
- Game: add support for mismatching the line form on the left and right side of GTL and MTE challenges
- Game: challenge generation (levels and randomization)

MEDIUM
- reuse LineFormGraphNode subclasses in game
- sort out duplication in IChallenge and ChallengeNode hierarchies

LOW
- Game: for GTE challenge, "Your line" equation shifts up and down when slope changes between fraction and integer
- consider using a subtle background color for buttons (Reset All, Save Line, Erase Lines)
- remove code related to SlopeEquationNode.PUT_UNSIMPLIFIED_SLOPE_ON_SEPARATE_LINE
- repackage, in anticipation of having 3 sims in this project

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS

TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines, should it be on same end of line as slope manipulator? or in Q1 or Q4 (as is) so that it's close to interactive line?
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")
- navigation game
- should intercept manipulator be same color as point manipulator? It's a special-case of point.
- Game: titles on equation boxes

HIGH
- Game: "Place 3 Points" challenge
- add slope tool (on "your line") when user has gotten challenge wrong and we're showing answer
- GTL: "Target line" -> "Line to Graph", "Your line" -> "Your Line"
- MTE: "Your line" -> "Your Equation", "Target line" -> "Correct Equation"
- move starting location of point tools

MEDIUM
- add support for fractional y-intercept in equations (only when y-intercept is non-interactive)
- move things to EquationNode base class (adding UndefinedSlopeIndicatorNode, creating slope nodes,...)
- sort out duplication in IChallenge and ChallengeNode hierarchies (introducing booleans for what's interactive should collapse a lot of things)

LOW
- review usages of Line.simplified
- add "verbose" mode to equation code, in case we want to show exactly what is in model
- repackage, in anticipation of having 3 sims in this project

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

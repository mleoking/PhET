TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- spinners or pickers for interactive equation? (InteractiveEquationNode or InteractiveEquationNode2)

HIGH
- implement Point-Slope tab
- prevent slope=0/0 in the interactive equation

MEDIUM
- when point tool is on a saved line, change the point tool highlighting when the user mouses over the saved line
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

LOW
- equations on lines are sometimes difficult to read when they overlap with other things
- clean up standard line icons (no equation on line, shorter line)
- change tip of point tool image, having it on a 45-degree angle makes it line up with slopes too often (eg, y=x, y=-x)
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- create spinner buttons programmatically, so they look more like line manipulators

TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- same or different colors for saved lines? if different, how to choose colors?
- does the origin need to be labeled (0,0)? if so, how?
- if "Graph lines" is unchecked, how does this affect controls that deal with lines on graph? are they disabled?

HIGH
- rise/run brackets
- drag handlers for slope and intercept manipulators
- mouse-over saved line to highlight

MEDIUM
- enable Save Line button immediately when Erase Lines has been pressed
- Save Line button is enabled when interactive equation changes, but the reduced form of the line may be the same
- show equations on lines
- point tool
- deal with undefined slope in SlopeInterceptLine
- reuse spinner buttons from fractions, see SpinnerButtonNode
- implement SlopeInterceptEquationNode

LOW
- horizontally center "Erase Lines" and "Reset All" under other controls
- improve look of title + show/hide button in equation control panel
- create check box icons

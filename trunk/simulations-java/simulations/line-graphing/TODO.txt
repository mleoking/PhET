TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- Game: for first incorrect guess, should we show the user's equation (for GTL) or line (for MTE)?
- P3P challenges: use similar but different colors for the 3 points?

HIGH
- move duplication in GTL_Challenge and MTE_Challenge into base class MatchChallenge
- move duplication in GTL_ChallengeNode, MTE_ChallengeNode and P3P_ChallengeNode into base class ChallengeNode
- Game: add support for mismatching the line form on the left and right side of GTL and MTE challenges (consult design doc)
- Game: challenge generation (levels and randomization)

MEDIUM
- rise value on slope tool falls off left edge of play area in Point-Slope tab
- slope tool rise/run can go off the graph for GTL challenges that don't manipulate slope (ie, "Set the y-Intercept", "Set the Point")

LOW
- document CoordinateSpinnerNode constructor
- implement RewardNode.setLevel so that we have unique rewards for each level
- remove code related to SlopeEquationNode.PUT_UNSIMPLIFIED_SLOPE_ON_SEPARATE_LINE

LOWEST
- move ownership of mvt from model to view
- Game: for GTE challenge, "Your line" equation shifts up and down when slope changes between fraction and integer
- consider using a subtle background color for buttons (Reset All, Save Line, Erase Lines)
- repackage, in anticipation of having 3 sims in this project

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

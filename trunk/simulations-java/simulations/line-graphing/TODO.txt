TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- controls for interactive equation (spinners, pickers, ...)
- point-slope: which forms? "(y-y1)=m(x-x1)", "y=m(x-x1)+y1", "m=(y-y1)/(x-x1)"; why and what benefit? only the first of these is really point-slope form
- point-slope: how to present x1 and y1 in interactive equation?
- point-slope: how to label lines on graph? reduced slope-intercept form? reduced point-sloped form (whatever that is)?
- point-slope: if we label lines with slope-intercept equations, should intercept be proper or improper fraction?
- point-slope: check box to hide equations on lines in graph
- point-slope: should blue manipulator be labeled (x1,y1)?
- move "lines" control panel closer to graph, into space reserved for moving point tools?
- interactive parts of equation different colors from static parts?

HIGH
- point-slope: radio buttons in close label for choosing point-slope variant
- Point-Slope: using interactive equation skips over values that would produce slope=0/0, but value in equation isn't updated
- duplication: SlopeInterceptDragHandler, PointSlopeDragHandler
- duplication: SlopeInterceptCanvas, PointSlopeCanvas
- duplication: SlopeInterceptModel, PointSlopeModel
- duplication: SlopeInterceptEquationControls, PointSlopeEquationControls

MEDIUM
- make division line between rise and run thicker in interactive equations (4f)
- subscripts on x1 and y1
- better handling and testing of adjustment to avoid slope=0/0
- Point-Slope: 2 variations of point-slope form
- outlined numbers (OutlineTextNode) in pickers are aliased
- numbers in pickers aren't always centered
- when point tool is on a saved line, change the point tool highlighting when the user mouses over the saved line
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- delete used interactive equation implementation(s) and associated image files

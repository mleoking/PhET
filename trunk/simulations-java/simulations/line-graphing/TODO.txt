TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN

HIGH
- use a lighter/brighter yellow for point tool highlight
- make minus sign more obvious in equations on graphed lines
- implement AP's user-interface component for incrementing/decrementing numbers in equation
- implement Point-Slope tab

MEDIUM
- create spinner buttons programmatically, so they look more like line manipulators
- clean up standard line icons (no equation on line, shorter line)
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model
- spinner alternative: small up/down arrows above/below each number

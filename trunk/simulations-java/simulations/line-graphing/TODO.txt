TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- point-slope: should blue manipulator be labeled (x1,y1)?
- move "lines" control panel closer to graph, into space reserved for moving point tools?
- interactive parts of equation different colors from static parts?

new spinner design:
- color that ties spinner to manipulator isn't visible until you mouse over
- should there be a color change or other feedback when pressed?
- should we use images files for buttons?

HIGH
- using interactive equation skips over values that would produce slope=0/0, but value in equation isn't updated
- duplication: SlopeInterceptDragHandler, PointSlopeDragHandler
- duplication: SlopeInterceptCanvas, PointSlopeCanvas
- duplication: SlopeInterceptModel, PointSlopeModel
- duplication: SlopeInterceptEquationControls, PointSlopeEquationControls

MEDIUM
- make division line between rise and run thicker in interactive equations (4f)
- subscripts on x1 and y1
- better handling and testing of adjustment to avoid slope=0/0
- Point-Slope: 2 variations of point-slope form
- outlined numbers (OutlineTextNode) in pickers are aliased
- numbers in pickers aren't always centered
- when point tool is on a saved line, change the point tool highlighting when the user mouses over the saved line
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- delete used interactive equation implementation(s) and associated classes and image files

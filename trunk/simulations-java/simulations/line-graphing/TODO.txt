TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- if user saves 2 lines with the same reduced form, they will see only 1 saved line (actually 2 identical lines on top of each other)
- will constraints on dragging manipulators be confusing? Eg, with b=-2, m can't be dragged higher than y=8
- Save Line button is enabled when interactive equation changes, but the reduced form of the line may be the same

HIGH
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant

MEDIUM
- keep saved and standard equations in model
- more sophisticated model of point tool, for highlighting and comparison of point to lines
- hide equation on interactive line when equation control panel in minimized
- improve layout of equation, try spinners in various layouts and locations
- make point tool light up when the point is on any graphed line
- when "Hide Lines" is unchecked, disable Save Line and Erase Lines buttons
- try dynamically changing the rise/run/intercept constraints to keep line manipulators on the grid
- try rise/run/intercept ranges of -5 to +5 (half grid range)
- clean up standard line icons (no equation on line, shorter line)
- try iOS Picker for changing numbers in equation

LOW
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- create spinner buttons programmatically to match colors

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SpinnerButtonNode, copied from fractions

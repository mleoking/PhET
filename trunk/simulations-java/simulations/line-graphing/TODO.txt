TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels very unbalanced for game challenges, very heavy on the graph side
- what to do with line manipulators during game states where line shouldn't be manipulated? hide? disabled? what does disabled look like?
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines

HIGH
- disable manipulators and hand cursors when not in FIRST_CHECK or SECOND_CHECK states
- create quick-and-dirty examples of each type of challenge
- offset values used for LineGameModel.mvt determine when the graph is located, and will vary depending on where the graph is located in the challenge. Better to have a location for the graph than mvt offset?
- some of the fields and responsibilities in LineGameModel are challenge specific. Eg, point tools, whether to maintain a list of lines, etc.

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- GameTimer, copied from BCE and RPAL
- RewardNode, copied and adapted from BCE and RPAL
- "game phase" framework
- standardize and move game strings to phetcommon? (Check, Try Again, Show Answer, Next)

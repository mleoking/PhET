TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- same or different colors for saved lines? if different, how to choose colors?
- does the origin need to be labeled (0,0)? if so, how?
- "Lines" check box state affects other controls (standard lines, rise/run, Save Line, Erase Lines)
- limit range of rise, run and intercept to 1/2 of grid range?
- change range to 0-20?
- constrain to quadrants 1 & 4, so that numerator is positive?
- what should point tool display while it's being dragged? nothing? closest grid point?
- when should point tool light up? when it's on the interactive line? when it's on any line?
- color scheme
- if user saves 2 lines with the same reduced form, they will see only 1 saved line (actually 2 identical lines on top of each other)
- layout problem with interactive equation, generally looks too spaced out, but needs to accommodate "-10"
- when you press "Save Line", you can't see your saved line
- will constraints on dragging manipulators be confusing? Eg, with b=-2, m can't be dragged higher than y=8

HIGH

MEDIUM
- enable Save Line button immediately when Erase Lines has been pressed
- Save Line button is enabled when interactive equation changes, but the reduced form of the line may be the same
- disable Save Line button when "Lines" is unchecked
- move static string methods from model (SlopeInterceptLine) to view

LOW
- add data-collection to SpinnerNode
- create spinner buttons programmatically to match colors, or investigate imageop to adjust hue
- improve look of title + show/hide button in equation control panel
- improve icons, generate programmatically to match colors?

TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- same or different colors for saved lines? if different, how to choose colors?
- does the origin need to be labeled (0,0)? if so, how?
- "Lines" check box state affects other controls (standard lines, rise/run, Save Line, Erase Lines)
- limit range of rise, run and intercept to 1/2 of grid range?
- change range to 0-20?
- constrain to quadrants 1 & 4, so that numerator is positive?

HIGH
- drag handlers for slope and intercept manipulators

MEDIUM
- enable Save Line button immediately when Erase Lines has been pressed
- Save Line button is enabled when interactive equation changes, but the reduced form of the line may be the same
- show equations on lines
- point tool
- reuse spinner buttons from fractions, see SpinnerButtonNode
- implement SlopeInterceptEquationNode

LOW
- round corners of rise/run brackets
- horizontally center "Erase Lines" and "Reset All" under other controls
- improve look of title + show/hide button in equation control panel
- create check box icons

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SpinnerButtonNode in fractions

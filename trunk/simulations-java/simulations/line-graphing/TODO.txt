TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")
- Game: more challenges?
- Game: rules for generating random challenges
- Game: GTL: should the guess equation be in simplified form, or correspond to exactly what the manipulators are set to?
- Game: GTL: how should the equations (answer vs guess) be labeled?
- Game: do we need point-slope challenges where only 1 component of point (x1 or y1) is interactive?
- Game: for failed challenge, should point and slope be plotted when answer is shown?
- Game: for correct MTE challenge, should point and slope be plotted?

HIGH
- random creation of challenges, subject to constraints tbd (or create a very large set of canned challenges)

MEDIUM
- use of Line.color is a bit of a mess, and makes it difficult to manage line lists
- change request: replace rise/run brackets with dashed lines with arrow heads on them
- use InteractiveEquationNode subclasses to generate non-interactive equations in EquationFactory subclasses, if we can agree that the "look" can be standardized
- sort out duplication in Challenge and ChallengeNode hierarchies (introducing booleans for what's interactive should collapse a lot of things)
- layout of EquationNode and InteractiveEquationNode subclasses is complicated, contains duplication, and will be difficult to maintain. Is there a better way?

LOW
- repackage in anticipating of having 3 sims in this project
- dynamic range manipulation in various GTL_SI_GraphNode subclasses is copied from LineFormsModel
- move GameConstants to LGConstants?

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

GAME CHALLENGES
Do each of these for "Make the Equation"
- slope-intercept form + slope variable (plot intercept)
- slope-intercept form + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + slope variable + intercept variable
- point-slope form + point variable
- point-slope form + slope variable (plot point)
- point-slope form + point variable + slope variable

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

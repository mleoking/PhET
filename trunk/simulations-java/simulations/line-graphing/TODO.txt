TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")

HIGH
- replace SlopeDragHandler with PointDragHandler, pass in a function that determines how the point is used - move (x1,y1) or (x2,y2), keep slope constant, etc.
- create additional game challenges

MEDIUM

LOW

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

GAME CHALLENGES
Do each of these for "Graph the Line" and "Make the Equation"
[DONE] slope-intercept form + intercept variable
[DONE] slope-intercept form + slope variable (plot intercept)
[DONE] slope-intercept form + slope variable + intercept variable
[DONE] slope-intercept form + 2 point manipulators
- point-slope form + point variable
- point-slope form + slope variable (plot point)
- point-slope form + slope variable + point variable
- point-slope form + 2 point manipulators

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

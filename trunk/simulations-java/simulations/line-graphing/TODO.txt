TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- controls for interactive equation (spinners, pickers, ...)

HIGH
- Point-Slope: interactive equation and control panel
- duplication: SlopeInterceptDragHandler, PointSlopeDragHandler
- duplication: SlopeInterceptCanvas, PointSlopeCanvas
- duplication: SlopeInterceptModel, PointSlopeModel

MEDIUM
- better handling and testing of adjustment to avoid slope=0/0
- Point-Slope: 2 variations of point-slope form
- outlined numbers (OutlineTextNode) in pickers are aliased
- numbers in pickers aren't always centered
- when point tool is on a saved line, change the point tool highlighting when the user mouses over the saved line
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- delete used interactive equation implementation(s) and associated image files

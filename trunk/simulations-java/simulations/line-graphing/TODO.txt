TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN

HIGH
- show "Your Line" (GLT) and "A Correct Equation" (MTE) only if they get the challenge wrong
- use only positive slopes for challenges in level 4 that force slope inversion
- ploy (x1,y1) for answer and guess if they get the challenge wrong
- in level 1, limit y-intercept range to (-5,5)
- in PTP challenges, only show guess lines in state=TRY_AGAIN || state==NEXT
- Game: generate challenges for levels 5-6

MEDIUM
- factor out duplication in ChallengeFactory hierarchy when the dust settles

LOW
- order of lines provided to point tool is not related to order of lines rendered on graph, would be nice if they used the same info

LOWEST
- Game: for GTE challenge, "Your line" equation shifts up and down when slope changes between fraction and integer

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review (JB)

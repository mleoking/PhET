TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines, should it be on same end of line as slope manipulator?
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")
- Game: Place N Points challenge
- Game: Parallel Line(s) challenge
- Game: Perpendicular Line(s) challenge
- Game: define levels and challenges

HIGH
- rewrite slope tool (see new design in 10/5 notes)
- use EquationNode.createSignNode, createOperatorNode, createFractionLineNode in subclasses
- add support for fractional y-intercept in equations
- "given equation" and "your equation" boxes, with check or X icons (icons outside boxes, on side towards graph)
- simplify lines in equation code
- query equations to determine location of "=", for horizontal alignment of vertically stacked equations, so their "=" operators line up (including "x={0} (slope undefined)")

MEDIUM
- move things to EquationNode base class, eg adding UndefinedSlopeIndicatorNode
- sort out duplication in Challenge and ChallengeNode hierarchies (introducing booleans for what's interactive should collapse a lot of things)
- layout of EquationNode subclasses is complicated. Is there a better way?

LOW
- add "verbose" mode to equation code, in case we want to show exactly what is in model
- use of Line.color is a bit of a mess, and makes it difficult to manage line lists
- repackage in anticipating of having 3 sims in this project

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

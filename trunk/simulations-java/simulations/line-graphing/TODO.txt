TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines, should it be on same end of line as slope manipulator? or in Q1 or Q4 (as is) so that it's close to interactive line?
- names for the 3 sims in this project ("Graphing: Lines", "Graphing: Linear Inequalities", "Graphing: Absolute Value")
- Game: Place N Points challenge
- Game: Parallel Line(s) challenge
- Game: Perpendicular Line(s) challenge
- Game: define levels and challenges

HIGH
- rewrite slope tool (see TODO items at top of SlopeToolNode)
- "given equation" and "your equation" boxes, with check or X icons (icons outside boxes, on side towards graph)
- query equations to determine location of "=", for horizontal alignment of vertically stacked equations, so their "=" operators line up (including "x={0} (slope undefined)")

MEDIUM
- add support for fractional y-intercept in equations (only when y-intercept is non-interactive)
- move things to EquationNode base class (adding UndefinedSlopeIndicatorNode, creating slope nodes,...)
- sort out duplication in Challenge and ChallengeNode hierarchies (introducing booleans for what's interactive should collapse a lot of things)
- layout of EquationNode subclasses is complicated. Is there a better way?

LOW
- review usages of Line.simplified
- add "verbose" mode to equation code, in case we want to show exactly what is in model
- use of Line.color is a bit of a mess, and makes it difficult to manage line lists
- repackage in anticipating of having 3 sims in this project
- EquationNode.setPaintDeep is buggy for dynamic or interactive equations

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

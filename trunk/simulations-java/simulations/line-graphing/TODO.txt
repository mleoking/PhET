TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN

SPINNER IDEAS
- AP's design
- iOS Picker with swipe gesture
- fractions buttons above/below numbers, buttons side-by-side
- small up/down arrows above/below each number

HIGH
- dynamically set the rise and intercept ranges, so that rise + intercept is constrained to the bounds of the graph (see IntroModel)

MEDIUM
- clean up standard line icons (no equation on line, shorter line)
- don't like all the MathUtil.round that's going on

LOW
- grid node gets bigger when IntroModel.GRID_MODEL_UNITS gets smaller, size should remain constant
- review internal duplication in GraphNode
- don't like having int methods in SlopeInterceptLine model

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- SpinnerButtonNode, copied from fractions

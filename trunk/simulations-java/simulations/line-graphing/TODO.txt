TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN

HIGH
- view isn't reset properly when replaying a challenge
- PTP challenge ranges: rise=(-5,5), run=(-5,5), x1=(-5,5), y1=(-5,5)
- Game: generate challenges for levels 5-6

MEDIUM
- factor out duplication in ChallengeFactory hierarchy when the dust settles

LOW
- order of lines provided to point tool is not related to order of lines rendered on graph, would be nice if they used the same info

LOWEST
- Game: for GTE challenge, "Your line" equation shifts up and down when slope changes between fraction and integer

LOOSE ENDS
- screenshot
- model.txt
- implementation-notes.txt
- code review (JB)

Concentration tab:

Concentration of a solution is:

   M = min( (saturatedConcentration (M), ( (amountOfSolute (moles)) / (volumeOfSolution (L)) ))

When a solution is saturated, the amount of precipitate is:

   precipitate (moles) = ( (amountOfSolute (moles)) / (volumeOfSolution(L)) ) - (saturatedConcentration (M))

The number of precipitate particles shown in the beaker is:

   numberOfParticles = (precipitate (moles)) * particlesPerMole

where particlesPerMole is specified for each solute.

The solvent is pure water. Solvent can be added to the solution using the faucet in
the upper-left corner of the play area.  Solvent can be removed from the solution using
the Evaporation control.

Solute can be added via either the shaker or dropper. The dropper contains a stock solution,
so it adds both solute and solvent. You can measure the concentration of the stock using
the Concentration meter.  Pressing the "Remove Solute" button removes all solute from
the solution.

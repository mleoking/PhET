TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- confusing to have different slider thumbs for Evaporation and Concentration sliders? (#3195, customize slider thumb)

HIGH
- Beers: collision detection for probe, don't allow dragging into cuvette
- Beers: should there be a model of light beam? view only right now
- Beers: make detector aware of whether it's in beam, and which part of the beam it's in
- Beers: detector only reads value when entire beam is fully hitting detector
- Beers: implement photon view, create a believable algorithm for how they are absorbed as they pass through solution (#2620, improve PhotonImageFactory)

MEDIUM
- common: #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph

LOW
- Concentration: #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode (#3195, change standard slider thumb)
- common: objects flicker/tear excessively while dragging (dropper, shaker, probes, cuvette, ...)
- Concentration: shaker dispenses more than the max amount of solute, we're not accounting for solute falling from shaker
- Concentration: use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?
- Beers: ruler can get lost behind solution control panel, move it to front layer when combo box #3242 is fixed
- Beers: add toolbox?
- common: meter bodies may run off right side of stage if text is too long

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to WavelengthControl (if I use it)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- ToggleButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>) - or delete if not used

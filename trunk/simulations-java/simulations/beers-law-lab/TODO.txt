TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- should shaker particles be removed when the shaker is made invisible?
- change probe sensor to use a shape instead of a point (what shape? what to do when the shape intersects >1 fluid?)

HIGH
- wrapper for WavelengthControl to use Property<Double>
- Beer's Law tab (see JC notes below)

MEDIUM
- fix resizing issue with LightControlNode, control panel width changes when dragging wavelength slider
- #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- shaker shouldn't dispense more than the max amount of solute

LOW
- switching from dropper to shaker causes 1 particle of solute to be created (cannot reproduce)
- make meter cable more curvy (ala Bending Light)
- shaker image has orientation=Math.PI built in, makes using shaker.orientation a little messy
- dropper flickers/tears excessively while dragging
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- fix potential issues in TiledBackgroundNode

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet

From JC's 1/24/12 email:
Tab 2 (see discussion in google doc for more details)
- We had a big discussion about the concentration slider number read out, and decided that each solution will have it's range shown using prefixes
  like milli and micro (symbols "m" and the greek letter mu, lowercase).  I will mock this up for future discussion.
- For now, light absorption/transmittance meter will not be allowed in the container.
- For now, do not include an absorbance curve for each solution, it gives away the answer.
- Decided to hide the wavelength slider with a checkbox option (I will mock up).
- We are considering adding a 3rd tab for custom solutions where students can change "a", but we haven't decided what exactly this tab would have.
  Discussions thus far look like it would resemble the Beer's Law Lab tab, but have different parameters and fewer solutions (maybe only 1 solution
  whose properties could be changed with controls.) But, before figuring out what that tab would do, we'd like to see what students do with the
  Beer's Law Lab tab, and what they learn from it.

TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 3/5/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- do we need to show the long names of the solutes in the combo box? this is taking up a lot of horizontal space

HIGH
- view of solute exiting shaker (magic particles, trajectory ala SASS)
- use precipitate color for particles exiting shaker
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker

MEDIUM
- make precipitate particles sit precisely on bottom of beaker

LOW
- rotate button on dropper so that lighting direction is consistent
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- spend a little time on combo box popup iss (create ticket, low priority)
- derive height of fluid columns coming out of faucets, instead of using hardcoded values (see ConcentrationCanvas)
- derive faucet locations and pipe lengths based on beaker location and size (see ConcentrationModel)
- fluid coming out of dropper and H2O faucet should stop at surface of solution in beaker
- solute combo box popup does behind concentration meter & probe

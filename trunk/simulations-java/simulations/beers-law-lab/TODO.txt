TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- confusing to have different slider thumbs for Evaporation and Concentration sliders? (#3195, customize slider thumb)

HIGH
- memory leak in photon view? starts acting strangely after running for awhile
- Beers: implement photon view

MEDIUM
- Beers: add variable wavelength feature
- common: add log interpolation of color to ColorUtils
- Concentration: 3-color range with min/max/center colors and concentration values
- Concentration: dev controls for color ranges and linear/log color interpolation
- common: #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph

LOW
- make ruler snap to 1cm increments, and/or remove some spacing on ruler ends?
- Concentration: #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode (#3195, change standard slider thumb)
- common: objects flicker/tear excessively while dragging (dropper, shaker, probes, cuvette, ...)
- Concentration: shaker dispenses more than the max amount of solute, model doesn't keep track of solute falling from shaker
- Concentration: use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?
- common: meter bodies may run off right side of stage if text is too long

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to WavelengthControl (if I use it)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- ToggleButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>) - or delete if not used

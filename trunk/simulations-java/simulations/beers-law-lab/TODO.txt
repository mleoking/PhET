TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN

CONCENTRATION 1.00 prep
- Concentration: screenshot

HIGH
- Beers: collision detection for probe, don't allow dragging into cuvette
- Beers: should there be a model of light beam? view only right now
- Beers: make detector aware of whether it's in beam, and which part of the beam it's in
- Beers: detector only reads value when entire beam is fully hitting detector
- Beers: color of photons doesn't change, create a believable algorithm for how they are absorbed as they pass through solution

MEDIUM
- Beers: meter and detector body images don't have transparent backgrounds (at rounded corners)
- Beers: increase space for radio buttons in AT detector images
- common: #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph

LOW
- Concentration: #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- Concentration: switching from dropper to shaker causes 1 particle of solute to be created (cannot reproduce)
- Concentration: shaker image has orientation=Math.PI built in, makes using shaker.orientation a little messy
- Concentration: dropper flickers/tears excessively while dragging
- Concentration: add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- Concentration: shaker shouldn't dispense more than the max amount of solute
- Concentration: use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?
- Beers: ruler can get lost behind solution control panel, move it to front layer when combo box #3242 is fixed
- Beers: add toolbox?

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to WavelengthControl (if I use it)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- ToggleButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>) - or delete if not used

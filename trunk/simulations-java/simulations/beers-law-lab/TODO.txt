TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- confusing to have different slider thumbs for Evaporation and Concentration sliders? (#3195, customize slider thumb)
- detector wire gets in the way of cuvette arrow, move arrow to top of cuvette?
- constrain probe to horizontal movement so that it's always aligned with beam?
- why can't detector read values inside the cuvette?
- should detector body be moveable? is so, why is it different from concentration meter?

HIGH
- Beers: implement photon view, create a believable algorithm for how they are absorbed as they pass through solution (#2620, improve PhotonImageFactory)
- Beers: add variable wavelength feature
- Beers: split detector probe image into foreground and background, so it looks like its passing through solution
- Beers: make detector work inside cuvette

MEDIUM
- common: #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph

LOW
- Beers: collision detection for probe, don't allow dragging into cuvette
- Concentration: #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode (#3195, change standard slider thumb)
- common: objects flicker/tear excessively while dragging (dropper, shaker, probes, cuvette, ...)
- Concentration: shaker dispenses more than the max amount of solute, model doesn't keep track of solute falling from shaker
- Concentration: use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?
- Beers: add toolbox?
- common: meter bodies may run off right side of stage if text is too long

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to WavelengthControl (if I use it)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- ToggleButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>) - or delete if not used

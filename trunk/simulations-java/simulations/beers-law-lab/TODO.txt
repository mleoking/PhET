TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- what color light to use for pure water?
- should color of beam segments (center and right) change as path length changes?
- should light have a momentary or toggle button?
- how is color range supposed to be utilized for concentration in 2nd tab?
- how to color sections of the beam? modulate alpha based on %transmission?
- are we using molar mass for anything?
- do photon colors change as they pass thru the solution, or are there simply fewer of them?
- how to deal with photon absorption? is distribution even across the width of the cuvette?

HIGH
- change arrow on cuvette at min/max of width range
- add absorbance and %transmission to solution model (start with Gaussian based on lambdaMax, later integrate JC's observed data)
- Light beam: add to model & view (3 segments); beam and photon views
- Detector: show vertical diameter line, for debugging; display proper values

MEDIUM
- meter and detector body images don't have transparent backgrounds (at rounded corners)
- increase space for radio buttons in AT detector images
- use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?
- fix resizing issue with LightControlNode, control panel width changes when dragging wavelength slider
- #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- shaker shouldn't dispense more than the max amount of solute

LOW
- switching from dropper to shaker causes 1 particle of solute to be created (cannot reproduce)
- shaker image has orientation=Math.PI built in, makes using shaker.orientation a little messy
- dropper flickers/tears excessively while dragging
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- fix potential issues in TiledBackgroundNode
- ruler can get lost behind solution control panel, move it to front layer when combo box #3242 is fixed
- Toolbox in Beer's tab?

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to WavelengthControl

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>)

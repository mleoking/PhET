TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- confusing to have different slider thumbs for Evaporation and Concentration sliders? (#3195, customize slider thumb)

HIGH
- why does wavelength slider get stuck at 630 when you start by trying to drag it to the right?
- memory leak in photon view? starts acting strangely after running for awhile
- Beers: implement photon view (drop this feature?)

MEDIUM
- Beers: add variable wavelength feature
- common: #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph

LOW
- Concentration: #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode (#3195, change standard slider thumb)
- common: objects flicker/tear excessively while dragging (dropper, shaker, probes, cuvette, ...)
- Concentration: shaker dispenses more than the max amount of solute, model doesn't keep track of solute falling from shaker
- Concentration: use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?
- common: meter bodies may run off right side of stage if text is too long
- color schemes: update color of precipitate particles that already exist (difficult)
- color schemes: linear vs log interpolation choice (is log useful?)

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to WavelengthControl (if I use it)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- ToggleButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>) - or delete if not used

TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 1.0 in April 2012

DESIGN
- what should happen when solute is changed?
- is a stubby dropper OK? because that's the only way we're going to fit a label and button
- if dropper is transparent and shows solution color, labels won't show up on some solutions
- move beaker ticks to left side, ala sugar-and-salt-solutions?
- tilt dropper, ala shaker?
- disable evaporation slider when beaker is empty?
- is there a maximum amount of solute? (will affect usability of dropper and beaker)
- is there a maximum amount of solution that the dropper can dispense?
- is there a maximum amount of solute that the shaker can dispense?
- split solute combo box items into 2 lines, so the control isn't so wide?

HIGH
- move shaker location to holes in shaker image
- move developer display to a dialog, add a button to access
- view of solute exiting shaker

MEDIUM
- get dropper assets from NP
- adjust drag bounds for shaker and dropper
- make precipitate particles sit precisely on bottom of beaker
- if we have limits on amount of solute, then make sure that we don't add solvent volume that would exceed the solute limit
- end of wire is visible in transparent center of probe

LOW
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- derive height of fluid columns coming out of faucets, instead of using hardcoded values (see ConcentrationCanvas)
- derive faucet locations and pipe lengths based on beaker location and size (see ConcentrationModel)
- fluid coming out of dropper and H2O faucet should stop at surface of solution in beaker

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet

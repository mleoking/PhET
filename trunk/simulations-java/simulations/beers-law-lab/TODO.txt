TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 3/5/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- split solute combo box items into 2 lines, so the control isn't so wide?

HIGH
- view of solute exiting shaker (magic particles, trajectory ala SASS)
- redo dropper image: start with original dropper, shorten cap and glass
- gray out "Remove Solute" button when there is no solute in the beaker
- start and reset with 0 moles in beaker
- change dropper's horizontal drag bounds to be full width of beaker (like shaker)
- spend a little time on combo box popup iss (create ticket, low priority)
- use precipitate color for particles exiting shaker
- compute stock color based on stock concentration, show stock inside dropper
- add color range for solutes (min-max), use min for >0 concentration, interpolate between min and max colors
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- try a 3D looking beaker (water glass from Fractions?)
- make maxSolute a model property, start with 10 moles, but may make this based on Solute.saturatedConcentration
- shaker and dropper: setEnabled(soluteInPlay<=maxSolute)
- make concentration meter read solution exiting: water faucet, drain faucet, dropper

MEDIUM
- experiment with making control panel less wide: split solute combo box items into 2 lines, vertically stack radio buttons
- make precipitate particles sit precisely on bottom of beaker
- if we have limits on amount of solute, then make sure that we don't add solvent volume that would exceed the solute limit

LOW
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- derive height of fluid columns coming out of faucets, instead of using hardcoded values (see ConcentrationCanvas)
- derive faucet locations and pipe lengths based on beaker location and size (see ConcentrationModel)
- fluid coming out of dropper and H2O faucet should stop at surface of solution in beaker
- solute combo box popup does behind concentration meter & probe

MIGRATE TO COMMON

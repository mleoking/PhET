TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 3/5/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- long names in solute combo box are taking up a lot of horizontal space
- should shaker particles be removed when the shaker is made invisible?

HIGH
- implement ShakerParticle.stepInTime and ShakerParticles.stepInTime (see SR notes below)
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- shaker shouldn't dispense more than the max amount of solute

MEDIUM
- Beer's Law tab (see JC notes below)
- make meter cable more curvy (ala Bending Light)

LOW
- shaker image has orientation=Math.PI built in, makes using shaker.orientation a little messy
- dropper flickers/tears excessively while dragging
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- fix potential issues in TiledBackgroundNode

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet


From SR's 1/2/12 email about behavior of salt particles in SASS:
class edu.colorado.phet.sugarandsaltsolutions.macro.model.MacroSalt extends MacroCrystal. That is a single crystal of salt that gets shaken out.
MacroSaltShaker creates the salt and adds it to the container.
Propagation and absorption in MacroModel.updateCrystals.
Bouncing off of walls is in MacroCrystal.stepInTime (called by MacroModel.updateCrystals).
I am not sure whether "abstraction + reuse" or "rewrite based on this example" will serve you better.

From JC's 1/24/12 email:
Tab 2 (see discussion in google doc for more details)
- We had a big discussion about the concentration slider number read out, and decided that each solution will have it's range shown using prefixes
  like milli and micro (symbols "m" and the greek letter mu, lowercase).  I will mock this up for future discussion.
- For now, light absorption/transmittance meter will not be allowed in the container.
- For now, do not include an absorbance curve for each solution, it gives away the answer.
- Decided to hide the wavelength slider with a checkbox option (I will mock up).
- We are considering adding a 3rd tab for custom solutions where students can change "a", but we haven't decided what exactly this tab would have.
  Discussions thus far look like it would resemble the Beer's Law Lab tab, but have different parameters and fewer solutions (maybe only 1 solution
  whose properties could be changed with controls.) But, before figuring out what that tab would do, we'd like to see what students do with the
  Beer's Law Lab tab, and what they learn from it.

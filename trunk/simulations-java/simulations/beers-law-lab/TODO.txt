TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 3/5/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- should the stock inside the dropper conform to the shape of the dropper glass, and fill the portion of the glass that overlaps the dropper cap?
- do we need to show the long names of the solutes in the combo box? this is taking up a lot of horizontal space

HIGH
- view of solute exiting shaker (magic particles, trajectory ala SASS)
- new dropper image and icon, with license.txt entries
- use precipitate color for particles exiting shaker
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- try a 3D looking beaker (water glass from Fractions?)
- make maxSolute a model property, start with 10 moles, but may make this based on Solute.saturatedConcentration

MEDIUM
- make precipitate particles sit precisely on bottom of beaker

LOW
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- spend a little time on combo box popup iss (create ticket, low priority)
- derive height of fluid columns coming out of faucets, instead of using hardcoded values (see ConcentrationCanvas)
- derive faucet locations and pipe lengths based on beaker location and size (see ConcentrationModel)
- fluid coming out of dropper and H2O faucet should stop at surface of solution in beaker
- solute combo box popup does behind concentration meter & probe

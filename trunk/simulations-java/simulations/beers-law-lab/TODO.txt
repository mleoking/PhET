TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- confusing to have different slider thumbs for Evaporation and Concentration sliders? (#3195, customize slider thumb)
- location of wavelength control makes it uninviting to drag probe between light and cuvette

HIGH

MEDIUM
- common: meter bodies may run off right side of stage if text is too long
- common: #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph
- common: #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode (#3195, change standard slider thumb)
- compute drag bounds of various movable objects based on stage size

LOW
- common: objects flicker/tear while dragging (dropper, shaker, probes, cuvette, ...)
- Concentration: shaker dispenses more than the max amount of solute, model doesn't keep track of solute falling from shaker
- Concentration: use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?

TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- should shaker particles be removed when the shaker is made invisible?
- change probe sensor to use a shape instead of a point (what shape? what to do when the shape intersects >1 fluid?)

HIGH
- add formula to solute combo box in Beer's tab
- Cuvette (vessel), variable width 0.5-2.0cm, resizable by dragging right edge, left edge location stays fixed
- Meter doesn't read anything in cuvette
- Concentration slider: different units to match the ranges for each solute (see design doc table, "Conc Range" column, which JC needs to verify)
- combine Solute combo box (labeled Solution) and Concentration slider in SolutionControls
- add "Pure water" to bottom of the Solutions combo box
- put solute formula above cuvette, not on it because it can get very narrow
- start with no Toolbox, add it later after exploring meter usability issues
- Beer's Law tab (see JC notes below)

MEDIUM
- i18n of "nm" (and other strings?) in WavelengthControl
- fix resizing issue with LightControlNode, control panel width changes when dragging wavelength slider
- #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- shaker shouldn't dispense more than the max amount of solute

LOW
- switching from dropper to shaker causes 1 particle of solute to be created (cannot reproduce)
- make meter cable more curvy (ala Bending Light)
- shaker image has orientation=Math.PI built in, makes using shaker.orientation a little messy
- dropper flickers/tears excessively while dragging
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- fix potential issues in TiledBackgroundNode

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to PropertyRadioButton
- add sim-sharing to RulerNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>)

From JC's 1/24/12 email:
Tab 2 (see discussion in google doc for more details)
- We had a big discussion about the concentration slider number read out, and decided that each solution will have it's range shown using prefixes
  like milli and micro (symbols "m" and the greek letter mu, lowercase).  I will mock this up for future discussion.

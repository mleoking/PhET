TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 1.0 in April 2012

DESIGN
- desired behavior of solute particles that fall out of shaker?
- what should happen when solute is changed?
- is a stubby dropper OK? because that's the only way we're going to fit a label and button
- make solution visible inside the dropper? how does this interact with solute label?
- move beaker ticks to left side, ala sugar-and-salt-solutions?
- is there a maximum amount of solute? (will affect usability of dropper and beaker)
- is there a maximum amount of solution that the dropper can dispense?
- is there a maximum amount of solute that the shaker can dispense?
- split solute combo box items into 2 lines, so the control isn't so wide?
- what colors to use for solute coming out of shaker? Solute.solutionColor? Solute.precipitateColor? other?
- does concentration meter need to read the concentration of the water faucet and drain faucet?

HIGH
- view of solute exiting shaker

MEDIUM
- adjust drag bounds for shaker and dropper
- make precipitate particles sit precisely on bottom of beaker
- if we have limits on amount of solute, then make sure that we don't add solvent volume that would exceed the solute limit

LOW
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- derive height of fluid columns coming out of faucets, instead of using hardcoded values (see ConcentrationCanvas)
- derive faucet locations and pipe lengths based on beaker location and size (see ConcentrationModel)
- fluid coming out of dropper and H2O faucet should stop at surface of solution in beaker
- solute combo box popup does behind concentration meter & probe

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet

TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 3/5/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN
- long names in solute combo box are taking up a lot of horizontal space
- should shaker particles be removed when the shaker is made invisible?

HIGH
- Beer's Law tab (see JC notes below)

MEDIUM
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- shaker shouldn't dispense more than the max amount of solute

LOW
- make meter cable more curvy (ala Bending Light)
- shaker image has orientation=Math.PI built in, makes using shaker.orientation a little messy
- dropper flickers/tears excessively while dragging
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode
- fix potential issues in TiledBackgroundNode

SIM-SHARING

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet

From JC's 1/24/12 email:
Tab 2 (see discussion in google doc for more details)
- We had a big discussion about the concentration slider number read out, and decided that each solution will have it's range shown using prefixes
  like milli and micro (symbols "m" and the greek letter mu, lowercase).  I will mock this up for future discussion.
- For now, light absorption/transmittance meter will not be allowed in the container.
- For now, do not include an absorbance curve for each solution, it gives away the answer.
- Decided to hide the wavelength slider with a checkbox option (I will mock up).
- We are considering adding a 3rd tab for custom solutions where students can change "a", but we haven't decided what exactly this tab would have.
  Discussions thus far look like it would resemble the Beer's Law Lab tab, but have different parameters and fewer solutions (maybe only 1 solution
  whose properties could be changed with controls.) But, before figuring out what that tab would do, we'd like to see what students do with the
  Beer's Law Lab tab, and what they learn from it.

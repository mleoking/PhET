TODO list for beers-law-lab

DEADLINES
- 5/14/12: "feature complete dev version, ready for interviews and/or classroom testing"

DESIGN

CONCENTRATION 1.00 prep
- screenshot
- #3242, make combo box popup appear on top of everything in the scenegraph
- #3199, bigger slider thumb on FaucetNode

HIGH
- collision detection for probe, don't allow dragging into cuvette
- should there be a model of light beam? view only right now
- show vertical diameter line in detector, for debugging
- make detector aware of whether it's in beam, and which part of the beam it's in
- detector only reads value when entire beam is fully hitting detector
- use gradient with modulated alpha for portion of the beam that passes through solution
- color of photons doesn't change, create a believable algorithm for how they are absorbed as they pass through solution

MEDIUM
- meter and detector body images don't have transparent backgrounds (at rounded corners)
- increase space for radio buttons in AT detector images
- use CompositeProperty for Shaker.dispensingRate?
- add soluteInPlay to model = solution.soluteAmount + solute falling from shaker
- shaker shouldn't dispense more than the max amount of solute

LOW
- switching from dropper to shaker causes 1 particle of solute to be created (cannot reproduce)
- shaker image has orientation=Math.PI built in, makes using shaker.orientation a little messy
- dropper flickers/tears excessively while dragging
- ruler can get lost behind solution control panel, move it to front layer when combo box #3242 is fixed
- Toolbox in Beer's tab?

SIM-SHARING
- add sim-sharing to WavelengthControl (if I use it)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- MomentaryButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- ToggleButtonNode to piccolo-phet
- TiledBackgroundNode to piccolo-phet
- BLLWavelengthControl (adapter for using WavelengthControl with Property<Double>) - or delete if not used

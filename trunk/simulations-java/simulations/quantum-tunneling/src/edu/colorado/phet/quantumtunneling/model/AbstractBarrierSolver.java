     * Gets the k value for a specified region, adjusted to address quirks with barriers.

     * For a single barrier if k2=0, and for a double barrier if k2=0 or k4=0,
     * the denominators in the coefficients go to zero so that the coefficients
     * themselves are undefined, so there is no plane wave. This is a quirk, as
     * everything is well-defined around these values.  
     * 
     * The workaround (prescribed by Sam McKagan) is a follows:
     * Whenever k2 or k4 is zero for barriers, set them to a small
     * positive value. Because k is used in an expotential, this small value
     * must be chosen to work properly with the precision used in this
     * simulation; a value that is too small or too large will result in
     * incorrect behavior.
     *  
     * The constant SMALL_K was chosen through a process of experimentation.
     * 
     * Note that k2 is in region 1, and k4 is in region 3.
     *

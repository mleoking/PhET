* reset kit broken bucket locations now!

Arrow and message that "you can put this in the collection box" at the start. Points to correct collection box.
Drop-down menu. Options: "Show in 3D", possibly show chemical formula, possibly option to move to collection box
Close relevant 3d views on: kit switch, break of molecule, or any other way the molecule isn't visible.
Only show 1 3d view of a particular molecule type at a time
Talk with translators (Sandor) about translating names. Developer recommendation: translate a subset
Synchronize colors with Jmol (sulfur and others look different colors in 3d views)
Bugfix: drag 2 atoms to the far lower-left at the start and they are pushed to cover each other (without bonding)
Find what molecules say they are "equivalent" to each other (some isomers pulled from PubChem seem identical to the sim model)
Add in a sound when a collection box is filled
Detect alcohols (or other structures) and modify their molecular formulas accordingly
Reduce delay (Jmol-caused) between clicking on "Show 3D" and it actually appearing
Investigate "molecular workbench", see if there are any other ideas
Possibly attempt to generate less kits? PENDING feedback
(dev) Internationalization
(dev) Switch to more mode-like canvas handling, instead of individual visibility handling

TESTING

Verify "Reset kit" unbondable bug is fixed

NOTES (questions):

Move reset button from bottom-right (or off bottom, or below)? Or back to the other way? Personally it feels a little weird now that I see it that way.

--- mostly completed (10): For molecular formulas, I was under the impression that the Hill System was the standard, however this gives us "H3N" for "NH3". Is there a
procedure or set of steps that can be used to get an accurate naming convention? (One way that may work would be to break the Hill convention and if
there is no carbon, STILL put the hydrogen first).
    There are a number of categories of naming systems, and unfortunately the molecules included in the sim span two cases, regular covalent compounds
    and organic compounds. For all molecules that are not organic (these contain C and H but do not include HCN) the names follow the rule that the
    symbols are listed in increasing order of electronegativity. Here’s a table of electronegativey ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity
    scroll down to periodic table view). For example, in HF, hydrogen has an electronegativity of 2.2 and fluorine has an electronegativity of 3.98,
    so the order is HF.
    For organic compounds, you start with C, then H, then whatever else...unless it’s an an alcohol in the case of CH3OH (this way of naming indicates
    something about the structure, that you have an OH group hanging off the side). So in short, would be naming rules that work for the molecules
    included in the sim:
        * If don’t include both C and H, name in increasing order of electronegativity
        * If includes C and H name with C first, then H, then whatever else.
    Exceptions:
        * NH3, name like organic where the H is second
        * HCN not considered organic, so name as regular covalent
        * CH3OH, name shows structure, doesn’t follow either naming convention.

Prevent 4 heavy atoms in a "square".
Add bubble with "Drag your molecule here" inside, or another phrase? (With blue arrow)
'+' to view 3d from collection box
Add BCE sound ding + bottom of collection box
Process molecule lists instead of (<=4 heavy) to (works with our kits)
Remove isomer developer control, and/or pulling from all molecules

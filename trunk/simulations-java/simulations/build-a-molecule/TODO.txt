I18nize text bubble
Prevent 4 heavy atoms in a "square".
Once an atom is selected and dragged close to another atom, it goes behind the atom. Can selected atoms that are being manipulated remain in front?
View 3D button from collection box
Add BCE sound ding + bottom of collection box
Process molecule lists instead of (<=4 heavy) to (works with our kits)
Remove isomer developer control, and/or pulling from all molecules
Smiley face on collection boxes completion?
Weird 3d structures?
Add in "molecule data loading"?

detection of molecules with those weird things like in 6432310, and check if it removes the name duplication issues earlier noted:

PENDING:
Emailed Sandor about translating names. Developer recommendation: translate a subset

TESTING:
I18n
Color blindness test

EVALUATION:
Better way to do label on arrow?
Possibly attempt to generate less kits? PENDING feedback
Developer option to make "Reset kit" not pull from collection box

Resize bug on AllFilledDialogNode
Make collection area not look so bad on switching
Collection boxes with >1 capacity should have a "fixed" position of where molecules go. Don't resize them on adding!
I18n and other TODOs
What about if you re-drag a molecule part just after combining?
Jmol loading speed is slow - speed up
Experiment with true 2d structure and loops!
Image cleanup
Note about dragging?
Naming
Text issues - buttonnode in panel
Potential collection area in 3rd tab?

TARGET - END OF JUNE

detection of molecules with those weird things like in 6432310, and check if it removes the name duplication issues earlier noted:

PENDING:
Emailed Sandor about translating names. Developer recommendation: translate a subset

TESTING:
I18n
Color blindness test

EVALUATION:
Better way to do label on arrow?
Possibly attempt to generate less kits? PENDING feedback
Developer option to make "Reset kit" not pull from collection box

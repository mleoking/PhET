What about if you re-drag a molecule part just after combining?
Weird 3d structures?
Size improvement on structures.txt (and serialized format)
Jmol loading speed is slow - speed up
Experiment with true 2d structure and loops!
Image cleanup
Note about dragging?
Naming
Remember include NO2 - nitrogen dioxide - 3609161

detection of molecules with those weird things like in 6432310, and check if it removes the name duplication issues earlier noted:

PENDING:
Emailed Sandor about translating names. Developer recommendation: translate a subset

TESTING:
I18n
Color blindness test

EVALUATION:
Better way to do label on arrow?
Possibly attempt to generate less kits? PENDING feedback
Developer option to make "Reset kit" not pull from collection box

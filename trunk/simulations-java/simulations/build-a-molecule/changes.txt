Removed text on blue hint arrow
Jmol 3D view uses same color scheme for atoms

Added blue "Collect your molecule!" arrow on 1st molecule that can be collected
While 3D view is open for a molecule, its '+' for 3D view button is grayed out (disabled)
Can only open 1 3D view for each molecule, and it closes whenever the molecule is hidden (broken, kit changes, put in collection box, etc)
Showing of 3D view dialog is immediate, and shows a "loading" message.

If the user sets acceleration and velocity then presses go, should switch to acceleration mode so the acceleration is not overwritten.
Dragging man should be absolute, not relative, so the mouse doesn't get offset after wall collision
Add chart zoom buttons
Test that record/playback works
Stop recording data after 20 seconds to avoid leaking
Borders for play area sliders on 1st tab?
Add a deceleration spike when accelerating into a wall.
Can't always type in text box values during recording
    When the text box gains focus, it should become the controlling variable and no longer a readout of changing values
Text boxes should be moved down and indented (see screenshots)
We will also need a new name for the new Moving Man, and I need to know whether we are also keeping the old one (as we are for forces-1d and ramp)
Why is acceleration magenta?  Won't that confuse with red?
Record and playback timeline doesn't synchronize size at the right time (seems one behind)
    When switching back and forth tabs in moving man, the playback timeline changes size.

For discussion:
Current resize rule is that charts get more area as screen gets bigger, but maybe moving man play area should get bigger too?

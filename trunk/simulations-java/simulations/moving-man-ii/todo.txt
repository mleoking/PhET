Dragging man should be absolute, not relative, so the mouse doesn't get offset after wall collision
Add chart zoom buttons
Fix layout so screen size can change
Test that record/playback works
Stop recording data after 20 seconds to avoid leaking
Borders for play area sliders on 1st tab?
Add a deceleration spike when accelerating into a wall.
Can't always type in text box values during recording
    When the text box gains focus, it should become the controlling variable and no longer a readout of changing values
Text boxes should be moved down and indented (see screenshots)
We will also need a new name for the new Moving Man, and I need to know whether we are also keeping the old one (as we are for forces-1d and ramp)
Why is acceleration magenta?  Won't that confuse with red?

# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- add more reactions to Game
- implement GameModel.newChallenges
- Game: animated curtains?
- what should be displayed in Game Summary?
- images will overlap in Game After box, grid has 20 cells, max images=40 (10x10x10x10 for 2 products, 2 leftovers)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- should Check button be visible with Game instructions, or appear when user enters a value?
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874
- associate ImageLayoutStrategy with the chemical reaction type?
- explicitly handle tab traversal in play area
- handle cleanup of dynamic nodes in GameCanvas.updateNodes
- i18n of GameSummaryNode
- factor out duplicate/similar code in AbstractBeforeNode, AbstractAfterNode, GameBeforeNode, GameAfterNode, GameBoxNode

LOW PRIORITY
- javadoc
- GameBoxNode is a lousy name for base class
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- move equation below Before/After boxes?
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)
- remove arrow code from GameInstructionsNode if arrow is not used

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode
- FaceNode

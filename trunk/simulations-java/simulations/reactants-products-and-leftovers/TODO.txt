# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- make changes so that stuff in first 2 modules can be used in Game module
- can't keep the "guess" in a ChemicalReaction, since the guess may not be a well-formed reaction

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874
- make ImageLayoutStrategy be associated with the chemical reaction type

LOW PRIORITY
- is there any issue with H image being 2 different sizes? (eg, in H2 and H2O)
- get Illustrator files for sandwich images from Noah P.
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- move equation below Before/After boxes?
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode

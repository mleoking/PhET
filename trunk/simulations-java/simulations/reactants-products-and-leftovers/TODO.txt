- Friday 3/19/10, version 1.0 on PhET website before ACS meeting

HIGH PRIORITY
- bread + cheese -> sandwich ?
- fixed sandwich coefficients ?
- "Hide" feature exposed in Game ?
- histogram bars visible ?

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- write description of model, check into doc/model.txt

LOW PRIORITY
- audible click in the correctAnswer.wav (appears in sound before optimization)
- add developer controls for setting up specific Game challenges (expensive, do this only if needed for debugging)

WARTS:

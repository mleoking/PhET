# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- ChemicalReaction model only responds to changes in reactant quantities, make it work in reverse for changes to products and leftovers

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874

LOW PRIORITY
- get Illustrator files for sandwich images from Noah P.
- scale image files to desired size, change scaling constants in RPALConstants
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- move equation below Before/After boxes?

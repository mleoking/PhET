# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

DEADLINES
- Wednesday 3/17/10, 1.0 release candidate published to dev
- Friday 3/19/10, version 1.0 on PhET website before ACS meeting

HIGH PRIORITY
- bread+cheese->sandwich
- allow choice of two sandwich types (bread+cheese, bread+cheese+meat) in SandwichShopModel (similar to RealReactionModel)
- add Unfuddle ticket for "choose sandwich type" user interface control
- generalize SandwichImageFactory, make it treat bread specially, but interleave all other types of ingredients

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- write description of model, check into doc/model.txt

LOW PRIORITY
- audible click in the correctAnswer.wav (appears in sound before optimization)
- add developer controls for setting up specific Game challenges (expensive, do this only if needed for debugging)

WARTS:
- Molecule.image is mutable solely for Sandwich, difficult to change this

MIGRATE TO COMMON

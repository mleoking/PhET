# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

DEADLINES
- 3/21/10, version 1.0 on PhET website before ACS meeting

HIGH PRIORITY
- design/relationship of GameCanvas and GameModel is confusing and brittle, redesign
- GameBeforeNode and GameAfterNode showGuess and showAnswer are confusing and brittle, redesign

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- dynamic sandwich image doesn't center itself properly, stacks are sometimes lop-sided or drift left
- remove silence from audio files, convert to WAV PCM mono
- small piece at rightmost edge of "How many..." message doesn't disappear (making text static did not fix this)

LOW PRIORITY
- developer controls for setting up specific Game challenges (expensive, do this if we need it for debugging)
- expose NumberOfVariablesChallengeFactory.main as a Developer menu item
- "1 O" in equations looks like "10" to SR, increase coefficient space? use a different font?
- javadoc

WARTS:
- Molecule.image is mutable solely for Sandwich, difficult to change this

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode

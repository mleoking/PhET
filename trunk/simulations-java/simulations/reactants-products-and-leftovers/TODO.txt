# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- Game: "guess" images in before/after boxes

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- should Game summary node be draggable?
- Game: animated curtains
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874
- make ImageLayoutStrategy be associated with the chemical reaction type?
- explicitly handle tab traversal in play area
- handle cleanup of dynamic nodes in GameCanvas.updateNodes

LOW PRIORITY
- GameBoxNode is a lousy name for base class
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- move equation below Before/After boxes?
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode

# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

DEADLINES
- 3/21/10, version 1.0 on PhET website before ACS meeting

HIGH PRIORITY
- have exactly one zero-products challenge per level
- design/relationship of GameCanvas and GameModel is confusing and brittle, redesign
- GameBeforeNode and GameAfterNode showGuess and showAnswer are confusing and brittle, redesign
- make histograms optional in code, publish a version without

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- dynamic sandwich image doesn't center itself properly, stacks are sometimes lop-sided or drift left, RHS of equation moves around
- when sandwich is defined as 2-meat, the image on RHS of equation is low
- piece of "s" in "leftovers" in "How many..." message doesn't disappear on Windows
- explicitly handle tab traversal in play area
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874

LOW PRIORITY
- remove game-reward-prototype from build file and strings file
- #2163, add "Back" feature to game
- is there an issue with Game timer, it showed 46:03 during status meeting, which was not possible
- developer controls for setting up specific Game challenges (expensive, do this if we need it for debugging)
- disable debug output in AbstractChallengeFactory
- remove silence from audio files, convert to WAV PCM mono
- expose SimpleGameStrategy.main as a Developer menu item
- "1 O" in equations looks like "10" to SR, increase coefficient space? use a different font?
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)
- javadoc

WARTS:
- Molecule.image is mutable solely for Sandwich, difficult to change this

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode
- FaceNode
- AudioResourcePlayer

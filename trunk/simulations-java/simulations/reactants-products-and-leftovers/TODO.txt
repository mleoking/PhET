# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- replace Substance.getNode with Substance.getImage, to prevent error of adding this node to the scenegraph multiple times

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- generalize After to assemble any number of displays

LOW PRIORITY
- scale image files to desired size
- clean up node scaling, it's kind of haphazard
- generalize any layout code that uses hardcoded offsets
- use rounding instead of trunc for snapping reactant quantity sliders
- delete IntegerSliderNode if it's not used

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode

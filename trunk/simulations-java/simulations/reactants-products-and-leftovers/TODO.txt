# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- GridLayoutStrategy can't find empty cells with Methane reaction and max reactant quantities
- design for Game module

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- product image histogram with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich is problematic, image extends below box, hard to stack to maintain histogram look

LOW PRIORITY
- scale image files to desired size, change scaling constants in RPALConstants

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode

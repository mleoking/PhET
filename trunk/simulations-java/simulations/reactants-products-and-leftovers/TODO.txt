# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

DEADLINES
- 3/21/10, version 1.0 on PhET website before ACS meeting

DESIGN
- definition of each game level
- game needs a replay motivator (persistence of previous scores?...?)
- game levels become irrelevant when user has figured out how to do these problems
- do we need a "hide quantities" feature in Game, to force users to work with images?
- sandwich image overlap in After box? with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, can't have both maintain correct histogram height and no overlap
- user interface and strategy for hiding molecule images in Game

HIGH PRIORITY
- factor out duplicate/similar code in AbstractBeforeNode, AbstractAfterNode, GameBeforeNode, GameAfterNode
- add an animated "prize" to Game Summary for perfect score, smiling molecules doing random walk, confetti in level 3
- design/relationship of GameCanvas and GameModel is confusing, revisit. Should model be state machine?
- #2161, layout of Game Summary dialog is messed up on Windows (rewrite in Piccolo?)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- dynamic sandwich image doesn't center itself properly, stacks are sometimes lop-sided or drift left, RHS of equation moves around
- when sandwich is defined as 2-meat, the image on RHS of equation is low
- developer controls for setting up specific Game challenges
- piece of "s" in "leftovers" in "How many..." message doesn't disappear on Windows
- disable debug output in AbstractGameStrategy
- explicitly handle tab traversal in play area
- is there an issue with Game timer, it showed 46:03 during status meeting, which was not possible
- automatically increase the level setting when user gets a perfect score?
- award more points for higher levels?
- instead of points, show stars & half stars? works for 5 challenges, allows student to remember which ones they didn't get
- lighter-weight methods (text?) of telling the user that the Game images will be hidden for a challenge
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874
- associate ImageLayoutStrategy with the chemical reaction type?
- investigate PSwing workaround that I had to add to GameSummaryNode

LOW PRIORITY
- remove silence from audio files, convert to WAV PCM mono
- expose SimpleGameStrategy.main as a Developer menu item
- "1 O" in equations looks like "10" to SR, increase coefficient space? use a different font?
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)
- javadoc

WARTS:
- Molecule.image is mutable solely for Sandwich, difficult to change this

INTERVIEW ISSUES:
- how many challenges per game is appropriate?
- what things make a challenge more difficult?
- does seeing the molecule images help you solve a challenge?
- what do you expect at higher game levels? more points? bigger rewards? other?

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode
- FaceNode
- AudioResourcePlayer

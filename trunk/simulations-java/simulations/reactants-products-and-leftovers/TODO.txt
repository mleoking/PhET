# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

DEADLINES
- 3/21/09, version 1.0 on PhET website before ACS meeting

HIGH PRIORITY
- developer controls for setting up specific Game challenges
- add more reactions to Game
- implement GameModel.newChallenges
- add an animated "prize" to Game Summary for perfect score
- move timerVisible out of GameModel, doesn't belong there
- handle cleanup of dynamic nodes in GameCanvas.updateNodes
- factor out duplicate/similar code in AbstractBeforeNode, AbstractAfterNode, GameBeforeNode, GameAfterNode, GameBoxNode

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- on mouseover, Game buttons become opaque and may hide molecule images
- "1 O" in equations looks like "10" to SR, increase coefficient space? use a different font?
- explicitly handle tab traversal in play area
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874
- associate ImageLayoutStrategy with the chemical reaction type?
- investigate PSwing workaround that I had to add to GameSummaryNode

LOW PRIORITY
- should Check button be visible with Game instructions, or appear when user enters a value?
- wait for interview results to decide if animated curtains are needed in Game
- javadoc
- GameBoxNode is a lousy name for base class
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode
- FaceNode

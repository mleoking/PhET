# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- make Before and After nodes support setReaction
- "Real Reactions" module

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- product image histogram with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich is problematic, image extends below box, hard to stack to maintain histogram look

LOW PRIORITY
- scale image files to desired size
- clean up node scaling, it's kind of haphazard
- generalize any layout code that uses hardcoded offsets
- use rounding instead of trunc for snapping reactant quantity sliders
- delete IntegerSliderNode if it's not used

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode

# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

- store coefficients, quantities, range, image with reactant and product model elements
- generalize formula to take any number of reactants and products
- keep leftovers in same position in Before and After boxes
- improve algorithm for putting images in Before and After boxes to minimize overlap
- general algorithm for creating a sandwich image from sandwich formula in SandwichNode
- general algorithm for calculating number of products
- highlight when mouseOver and dragging reactant quantity sliders
- use rounding instead of trunc for snapping reactant quantity sliders

# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- prevent overlapping images in RandomBoxLayoutStrategy
- design for Game module

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- product image histogram with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich is problematic, image extends below box, hard to stack to maintain histogram look

LOW PRIORITY
- scale image files to desired size, change scaling constants in RPALConstants
- generalize any layout code that uses hardcoded offsets

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode

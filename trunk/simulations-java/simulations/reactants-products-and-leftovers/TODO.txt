# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- keep leftovers in same position in Before and After boxes
- improve algorithm for putting images in Before and After boxes to minimize overlap (6x5 grid of cells)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- store coefficients, quantities, range, image, location with reactant and product model elements
- generalize formula to take any number of reactants and products
- generalize Before to assemble any number of controls
- generalize After to assemble any number of displays
- general algorithm for calculating number of products

LOW PRIORITY
- clean up node scaling, it's kind of haphazard
- use rounding instead of trunc for snapping reactant quantity sliders

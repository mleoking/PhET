# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

DEADLINES
- 3/21/10, version 1.0 on PhET website before ACS meeting

HIGH PRIORITY
- expose SimpleGameStrategy.main as a Developer menu item
- add sounds to Game (correct, try again, game over, perfect score), see RadioactiveDatingGameCanvas._soundState
- factor out duplicate/similar code in AbstractBeforeNode, AbstractAfterNode, GameBeforeNode, GameAfterNode, GameBoxNode
- rename GameBoxNode, it's a lousy name for base class
- developer controls for setting up specific Game challenges
- add an animated "prize" to Game Summary for perfect score, smiling molecules doing random walk, confetti in level 3

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- explicitly handle tab traversal in play area
- is there an issue with Game timer, it showed 46:03 during status meeting, which was not possible
- automatically increase the level setting when user gets a perfect score?
- award more points for higher levels?
- instead of points, show stars & half stars? works for 5 challenges, allows student to remember which ones they didn't get
- don't show Score: X/max in scoreboard, just show Score: X, then show X/max in Game Summary?
- lighter weight methods (text?) of telling the user that the Game images will be hidden for a challenge
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874
- associate ImageLayoutStrategy with the chemical reaction type?
- investigate PSwing workaround that I had to add to GameSummaryNode

LOW PRIORITY
- "1 O" in equations looks like "10" to SR, increase coefficient space? use a different font?
- wait for interview results to decide if animated curtains are needed in Game
- javadoc
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode
- FaceNode

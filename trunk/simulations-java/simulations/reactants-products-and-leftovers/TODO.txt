# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- ChemicalReaction model only responds to changes in reactant quantities, make it work in reverse for changes to products and leftovers

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874

LOW PRIORITY
- is there any issue with H image being 2 different sizes? (eg, in H2 and H2O)
- get Illustrator files for sandwich images from Noah P.
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- move equation below Before/After boxes?
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode

# TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH PRIORITY
- Game: value nodes below before/after boxes
- Game: images in before/after boxes
- Game: Summary dialog
- Game: state machine to control visibility of game nodes
- investigate layout oddities with Scoreboard (rewrite in Piccolo?)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Game: animated curtains
- PSwing memory leak affects tab traversal, #1874
- make ImageLayoutStrategy be associated with the chemical reaction type

LOW PRIORITY
- with 3+3+3=1 Sandwich, hard to maintain correct histogram height and see individual sandwiches
- move equation below Before/After boxes?
- set font size of spinners instead of scaling (up/down arrows don't resize on Mac)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- BracketedLabelNode
- IntegerHistogramBarNode

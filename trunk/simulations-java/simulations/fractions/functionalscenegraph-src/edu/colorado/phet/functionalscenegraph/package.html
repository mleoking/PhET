Experiment with a more functional rendering approach. Some features to consider:
1. nodes are immutable. This will allow caching, replacement, reuse in multiple time steps, reuse in different parts of the scene tree, etc.
2. use a differencing algorithm to compare two scene graphs to see what changed and needs to be repainted.

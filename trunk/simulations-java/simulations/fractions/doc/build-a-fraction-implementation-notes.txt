Build a Fraction uses Piccolo-oriented programming instead of functional programming (which is used the rest of the fractions sim).
More details regarding the trade-offs and decisions are available in phet-functional-programming.pdf

Nodes are re-used instead of created, which facilitates animation.  Global to local transforms are used to keep nodes in the same place as they move between subtrees.
Also, in this sim, nodes in the toolbox (shape pieces, shape containers, number cards and fraction skeletons) are draggable from the toolbox--
this differs from design of other sims which instead show an icon then create the draggable instance once the mouse is pressed or dragged.

There are 2 types of levels: one in which you build using number cards (see NumberSceneNode), and 1 in which you build using pictures of shape pieces (see ShapeSceneNode).

The levels are declared in ShapesLevelList and NumbersLevelList.  Some levels choose the targets first then come up with cards that can be used to solve the challenges.
Other levels to use the cards first then come up with challenges that can be obtained with those cards.
For the shapes mode in order to come up with good challenges we find all possible solutions then sort by number of cards in the solution and choose from one of the smaller solutions,
so there aren't too many shape cards to move around.

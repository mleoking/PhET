For the Fractions Intro tab, this sim uses a functional/immutable model.

Convention for copy methods is to use method of the name of the variable and to call the constructor with the
arguments of the same names as the parameters to make it easy to see that everything is correct. Due to the abundance of copy methods,
this sim uses single-line methods "simple methods in one line" in IntelliJ code style.  For example,
if the main constructor was State(name,x,y), then the copy method for x would be:

public State x(double x){ return new State(name,x,y);}

To support the functional paradigm, this sim used FunctionalJava, http://functionaljava.org/

Intro tab:
The maximum number of pieces allowed on the screen is 6--this cannot be exceeded by increasing the numerator or by decreasing the denominator.
So as the user adjusts the numerator, then numerator's max is a function of the (fixed) denominator:

    n / d <= MAX , so n<=MAX * d

Similarly, when the user adjusts the denominator, the minimum of the denominator is a function of the (fixed) numerator:
    n / d <= MAX
so
    n<=MAXd
or
    d >= n/MAX

Equality lab:
The maximum number of pieces allowed on the screen is 4--this cannot be exceeded by increasing the numerator or by decreasing the denominator.

These constraints were added to productively constrain the user to a reasonable range of values.

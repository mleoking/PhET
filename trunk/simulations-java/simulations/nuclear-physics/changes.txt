# 3.05.04 (28367) Feb 11, 2009
> Changed tunneling diameter for alpha particles so that it won't look like they were flying away when they're not.
# 3.05.03 (28282) 02-09-2009
Made the energy lines on the 2nd tab move when switching between nuclei in order to be more noticeable.
# 3.05.02 (28226) 02-06-2009

# 3.04.16 (27215) 01-13-2009
New rev because previous deployment attempt failed.
# 3.04.15 (27214) 01-13-2009
> Added "Reset Nuclei" functionality to 2nd tab, fixed a number of bugs with containment vessel.
> Fixed a number of bugs with Reset All on the 2nd tab.
> Made the lines and cirlce that depict the tunneling radius on the 2nd tab change with the energy levels.
# 3.04.11 12-31-2008
> Made the reset buttons on the 1st and 3rd tabs be hidden until they are actually usable.  This should help users to see them and to understand what they do.
> Changed the way in which the neutrons are injected into the nuclear reactor on the 3rd tab.  It is now initiated from a labeled button on the top of the reactor.
> Made the graphs on the Nuclear Reactor tab always visible.
> Replaced the "Fire!" button on the ray gun with a simple, unabled red button.

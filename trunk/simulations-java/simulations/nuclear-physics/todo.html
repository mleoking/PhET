<ul>
<li> Add limited region fission, with a containment box
<li> When a neutron hits a U239 nucleus it should just pass through, not be absorbed
<li> For one-nucleus fission: have the nucleus vibrate and neck down before it splits


<li>Now that I have GraphicsSetups set for individual graphics,
add a means to reset them back to what they were before setup()
was called.
<li>Make sure that the profile graphic is shaded properly.
<li>make a Vector2D.Double class
<li>complete kinematics for Body
<li>fold CubicUtil into MathUtil
<li>do away with DecayProducts class???
</ul>


        <ul>
- tie clock on Alpha Decay panel to simulation clock, not system clock
<li>shade the interior of the potential profile
<li>make profile be in first quadrant
<li>delete DecayProducts from CVS and add AlphaDecayProducts
<li>make a Vector2D.Double class
<li>complete kinematics for Body
<li>fold CubicUtil into MathUtil
</ul>


        - Double daughters in reactor


- Frame doesn't always come up completely until you resize it
- Performance is very much frame-size dependent
- Single fission panel should work differently: Nucleus should jump to higher level instantaneously. The necking should
vibrate without the CM moving
- Fission products should have same momentum, not speed
- "Slow Motion" button
- Make NucleusGraphic a PhetImageGraphic for performance?
- percent fisioned text field isn't right while nuclei are being added
- kabooms need to be on a layer above the containment vessel
- listeners and leaveSystem() implementations are spread around in odd places
- is more than one kaboom being made per fission?

# 3.06.00 (28488) Feb 13, 2009
> Fixed an issue where the alpha particles would sometimes appear to be leaving the nucleus when in fact they weren't
# 3.05.04 (28367) Feb 11, 2009
> Changed tunneling diameter for alpha particles so that it won't look like they were flying away when they're not.
# 3.05.03 (28282) 02-09-2009
Made the energy lines on the 2nd tab move when switching between nuclei in order to be more noticeable.
# 3.05.02 (28226) 02-06-2009
> Added a pie chart to depict proportion of decayed nuclei, changed half life marker position for custom nucleus, changed label colors.
# 3.05.01 (27761) 01-28-2009
> Fixed issue where the bucket label was not correct when the custom nucleus was selected.
# 3.05.00 (27554) 01-22-2009
Deployment to the production web site.
# 3.04.23 (27545) 01-22-2009
Removed non-function "Clear Chart" button from time diagram on first tab, made other improvements to chart.

# 3.04.20 (27318) 01-15-2009
# 3.04.19 (27314) 01-15-2009
> Added exponential time display, changed behavior of well drop.
# 3.04.18 (27261) 01-14-2009
> Revised the behavior of the reset button on the 2nd tab based on feedback from users.
# 3.04.17 (27219) 01-13-2009
New rev because previous deployment attempt failed (again)
# 3.04.16 (27215) 01-13-2009
New rev because previous deployment attempt failed.
# 3.04.15 (27214) 01-13-2009
> Added "Reset Nuclei" functionality to 2nd tab, fixed a number of bugs with containment vessel.
> Fixed a number of bugs with Reset All on the 2nd tab.
> Made the lines and cirlce that depict the tunneling radius on the 2nd tab change with the energy levels.
# 3.04.11 12-31-2008
> Made the reset buttons on the 1st and 3rd tabs be hidden until they are actually usable.  This should help users to see them and to understand what they do.
> Changed the way in which the neutrons are injected into the nuclear reactor on the 3rd tab.  It is now initiated from a labeled button on the top of the reactor.
> Made the graphs on the Nuclear Reactor tab always visible.
> Replaced the "Fire!" button on the ray gun with a simple, unabled red button.
> Incorporated a new version of the ray gun image and made the "Fire!" button on the ray gun translatable.
# 3.04.11 12-31-2008
******* 3.02.01
> Split into two simulations, one for Nuclear Fission and one for Alpha Decay

# 0.00.16 (48875) Feb 13, 2011
Fixed intensity meter for light wave representation
Fixed: Protractor drag areas are incorrect, should only be able to mouse over on the solid part, not the bounding box
Fixed: When dismissing the intensity sensor with the "x" button, when dragging it out again it starts in the wrong spot.
# 0.00.15 (48867) Feb 12, 2011
Fixed: reflected wave is out of phase with incoming wave
Added clock controls to the play area when "wave" mode is selected
Fixed: transmitted wavelength is incorrect
Fixed: transmitted wave is out of phase with incoming wave
# 0.00.14 (48857) Feb 11, 2011
Adjust wave widths to constrain the incident cross sectional width the be fixed
Fixed: speed in wave view is angle dependent, even for incoming wave
# 0.00.13 (48854) Feb 10, 2011
Fixed: Wavelength in n2>n1 should be shorter, not longer
# 0.00.12 (48852) Feb 10, 2011
Fixed areas at interface of mediums
# 0.00.11 (48850) Feb 10, 2011

Fixed: normal line overlaps with the toolbox
Made it possible to drop intensity sensor back in the toolbox
Made it possible to drop protractor back in the toolbox
Fixed: Intensity meter should go back to the toolbox when the close button is pressed
Fixed: Intensity meter is in the wrong location when dragged out of the toolbox
Added a toolbox with draggable icons
Show "n=?" for mystery objects
Hide slider for mystery objects
Split apart control panel into laser view and tools
Fixed: protractor intercepts mouse events when invisible
Added MediumControlPanel

Increased size of intensity meter and protractor
# 0.00.08 (48746) Feb 8, 2011
Fixed protractor location
# 0.00.07 (48744) Feb 8, 2011
Rounded the corners of the control panel
Minimized range of slider to prevent overlap of tick labels in English
Made drag arrows round instead of straight
Improved coordinate frames
Intermediate fixes for coordinate frames
Changed air to be white instead of black
Changed normal line to be black instead of yellow
Improved medium colors to support air=white instead of air=black
Start the intensity meter in the bottom right
Start the protractor in the lower-left corner
Moved the control panel layer in front of the horizontal line
Moved the laser back to the top layer and made media opaque
# 0.00.06 (48693) Feb 6, 2011
Fixed: only show drag arrow in the direction the laser can be moved
# 0.00.05 (48691) Feb 6, 2011
Added rotation path arrows on mouse hover for laser pointer
Made the protractor draggable
Moved the camera to the right so the origin is centered in the play area
Moved the laser behind the medium
Added transparency to the mediums
Improved colors for large indices of refraction
Added tick marks to the index of refraction sliders
Fixed: sim should start with laser off
Added a line that will show the border between the mediums even when both n's are the same
Fixed: laser on/off button does not switch images right now
Fixed: The laser beam could be a little thicker, maybe 2x what it is now?
# 0.00.04 (48679) Feb 5, 2011

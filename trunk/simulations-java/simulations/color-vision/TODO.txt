"To Do" list for "colorvision" simulation

- redesign of "RGB Bulbs" module, lights shine on a piece of paper, person looks at the paper
- add a readout (0-100%) to intensity sliders in "RGB Bulbs" module
- add "Beam" view to "RGB Bulbs" module
- move "Bulb Color" control closer to and above "Filter Color" control in "Single Bulb" module
- add Help, based on Aaron's screenshots
- add MegaHelp, as provided by Aaron

- background color on Windows

LOW:

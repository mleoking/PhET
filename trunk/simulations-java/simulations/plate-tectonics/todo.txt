Tab 1:
    Create tools for the toolbox, hook them up to the model and allow them to move as normal.
        SR: Should these be 2D or 3D objects?
    Add the ability to switch between density and temperature views?
        SR: Or just provide a mixed view that is always on?  More dense = denser lattice texture, hotter=redder?
    Model improvements. Currently includes hacks. PENDING on Noah?
    Create a "crust" icon that the student needs to drag into an empty "crust-less" slot? (is this needed?)
        SR: With the current design, I'd recommend against having the student drag a crust into the empty crust-less slot

Tab 2:
    Everything!

General:
    Refactoring and Cleanup.
    I18n
        SR: I internationalized what is here, but I'll leave this on the list since more string will be added to the sim

Technical:
    Add cursor handling (see Molecule Shapes)
    Add code to compute 3D x,y,z positions from a 2D x,y screen position (see Molecule Shapes)
    Improve texturing and texture handling for the terrain and cross sections. (Independent texture sampling for the terrain!!!)
    Fix texturing of terrain for non-square aspect ratios
    Improve non-square aspect ratios and bounds for the cross section

Implementation Notes for Plate Tectonics

It is first of all highly recommended that you should read lwjgl-implementation-notes.txt (at lwjgl-phet) and this document before digging into much
of the code.


*** High Level Overview

Since we can have only one LWJGL display canvas at one time, this simulation technically has only one module (a TabbedModule), which has multiple tabs
(LWJGLTab instances). lwjgl-phet handles the boilerplate that lets us use the same canvas by multiple tabs, and handles event and state conversions
when tabs are switched. End result: we have CrustTab and PlateMotionTab instead of modules (PlateTectonicsTab contains shared tab code).

Each tab has a single model instance (CrustModel and PlateMotionModel, PlateTectonicsModel contains shared behavior).

Each model is generally composed of the basic building blocks:
    * Terrain instances, which model a patch of the surface of the earth
    * CrossSectionStrip instances, which model a (generally) horizontal strip of the earth cross-section
    * Region instances which are composed of CrossSectionStrips stacked vertically, each separated by boundaries
    * Plate instances, which have references to their relevant terrain and crust / lithosphere regions
Each model also allows querying the temperature / density at arbitrary points (for user-controlled sensors, etc.)

Regions are generally a conceptual unit of cross-section (the crust of a plate), and are effectively specified by a grid of Sample instances which
specify locations along with temperature and density at that point. The model isn't just a list of plates because we can have regions that don't
belong to plates (like a combined mantle or earth core, or magma chambers), etc.

Each tab creates a PlateTectonicsView that is responsible for displaying the Earth view (water / terrain / cross-section / etc.) of the relevant
mode. Each tab is then responsible itself for creating the overlays and controls necessary.

Also of note are the various coordinate transformations that the model coordinates go through onto the screen:
"Planar" model coordinates:
    All model locations (Samples, etc) are in what I called "planar" coordinates. The Y coordinate is the elevation relative to sea-level.
    X and Z wrap around the globe left/right and front/back.
    Technically, these are a rescaled version of Spherical Coordinates (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system), where X/Z
    are effectively re-scaled angles such that at sea-level, the X/Z coordinates move you along the circumference of the earth by that distance.
    Thus (0,0,0) and (earth-circumference,0,0) map to the same physical point (the origin is the "top" of the earth, which is the frontmost center point)
    Using this warped system is extremely convenient for all of the elevation-dependent and up/down/left/right transformations needed by the model.
    PlateTectonicsModel.convertToRadial() converts to -->
"Radial" model coordinates:
    These are the Euclidean coordinates for the 3D system, where the earth center is at (0,-earthRadius,0).
    (tab) modelView transform -->
View coordinates:
    General view coordinates, where other things in the scene may be added.
    OpenGL MODEL_VIEW transform (different from the above transform) -->
Eye coordinates:
    OpenGL PROJECTION transform -->
(Other viewport transformations, etc. that are set up by LWJGL)

*** "Plate Motion" Tab-specific Information

Since we are not directly controlling the frame-rate (only limiting it so we don't use up all computational power), code written for this tab
is given the simulation time passed in a frame (usually in millions of years). We use a custom TectonicsClock that is pushed forward by a variable
amount each frame. The clock's "speed" is changed by how fast the simulation should run (controlled either by handles in manual mode or an explicit
speed slider in automatic mode), and allows for time-limits for each situation.

The state of the model (and how it needs to react to the user) is very helpful to understand. Here's a simplified (linear) state machine view of
the model (note that the user can switch between automatic and manual mode at any time):

A) No crusts dropped (i.e. like the start of the simulation)
    * user drops two crusts into place (plate.droppedCrust() is called for each) -->
B) Crusts initialized, but no motion type or behaviors set or chosen. model.hasBothPlates flag is true
    * user can change model.motionTypeIfStarted in automatic mode with the motion type radio buttons (with green / red / blue icons),
      but it isn't set in stone
    * user either drags the handles in a specific direction (manual mode) or presses play for 1st time (automatic mode) -->
C) Motion type fixed (won't change), plate-specific behaviors are created depending on crust types. model.animationStarted flag is true
        (model.initializeBehaviors() is called after model.motionType is set)
    * user can animate as they want (automatic or manual mode)
    * user presses "Rewind" --> rewinds animation, goes to (C) with same motion type / behaviors
    * user presses "Reset" --> goes to (A)

PlateMotionModel also includes label models (the positioning is much easier to deal with in the model), and it uses PlateMotionPlate subclass
instances for the plates with added behavior.

The behaviors mentioned earlier are instances of PlateBehavior, and they are assigned to each plate. Each behavior is solely responsible for plate
changes each timestep (for instance, causing a plate to subduct).

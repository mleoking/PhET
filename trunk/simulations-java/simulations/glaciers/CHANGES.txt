Change history for glaciers
================================================================================

DESIGN ISSUES (user interface):
- [159] user-interface design for climate experiments

HIGH PRIORITY:
- replace Glacier._surfaceAtSteadyStateELA with something cleaner?
- add framework that allows tools to delete themselves? (eg, flag crushed by glacier)
- make advancing glaciers delete flags that are on valley floor
- morph or move ice textures to show downvalley motion (how to do this? different points in texture have different velocities!)
- visual representation of snowfall
- create framework for specifying drag-&-drop constraints for tools
- add moving glyphs to ice surface to show motion
- use solid colors for ice surface and cross-section
- add 3D model and pseudo-3D view for debris that moves in/on glacier

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- change cursor to universal "no" symbol when tools are at an illegal drop location
- when a tool is dragged from the toolbox and dropped illegally, snap it back to the toolbox (animated?)
- when a tool is dragged in the world and dropped illegally, snap it back to its location at the start of the drag (animated?)
- make ice thickness tool adjust its caliper to fit the ice thickness
- thermometer can be dropped above ice cross-section
- thermometer displays "?" when advancing glacier overlaps a thermometer, or when in illegal drop location
- tracer flags can be dropped in the ice cross-section or on surface (snaps to top of cross section)
- ice thickness tool can be dropped anywhere its image intersects valley floor or ice cross-section
- ice thickness tool shows "?" when in illegal drop location
- borehole drill can be dropped above the ice cross-section
- drill a borehole each time mouse button is released on borehole drill
- always collect data for time-based graphs, keep "latest" & "historical" data points, compress historical, limit historical size
- add zoom in/out button for time-based graphs; show scrolling "latest" data or complete "historical"
- fake rocks using ice textures
- fake moraine formation using a Hollywood model
- extruded portion of ice jiggles at headwall while it's evolving
- remove yaw from mountains image perspective, or add yaw to ice perspective (wait until tools behavior is finalized)
- model borehole as a set of moving points, connected via line segments
- adjust magnification of zoomed view?
- adjust aspect ratio?
- add Advanced panel

LOW PRIORITY:
- remove registration points from mountains image
- creating a tool and dragging it straight to the trash doesn't work because we're in the middle of an event sequence
- developer controls for ice velocity "look"?
- add moving debris (if textures are not convincing enough)
- make mountains image big enough so that all we see is sky when the birds-eye view is made very wide
- generalize all charts, there's too much duplicated code (ditto in controller that wires control panel to charts)
- confirm that titles and axes on graphs are as desired
- fancy animation when a tool is dropped in the trash
- constrain tools to dragging in birds-eye bounds (necessary? tools are inexpensive)
- refactor common module functionality into a base class
- fix layout problems with main control panel
- is changing frame rate the right way to change clock speed for this sim?
- improve smoothness of DistanceAxisNode (x-axis for coordinates feature)
- implement Save/Load feature
- close & reopen graph windows when switching modules
- make zoomed viewport follow terminus (defer until we decide whether this is really needed)
- add Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers
- ticks & labels on sliders should be white, code to set their color is not working (Mac only?)
- display distance and/or elevation as km ?
- make mercury in thermometers move as temperature changes
- add rounded borders to control sub-panels
- main control panel should be the same height in all modules
- why doesn't image created by GPSReceiverNode.createImage show coordinate values? Is it because PSwing component isn't realized?
- rotate some of the tool icons to reduce height of toolbox?
- PlayArea.verticallyAlignZoomedViewport makes a change to viewport and results in itself being called again (it works, but not very elegant)
- should "Glacial Budget vs Elevation" chart show negative ablation?
- add rocks falling off mountains onto glacier surface?
- do we want to show values or relative ranges (cold-to-hot) for climate controls?

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Valley.getX uses divide-and-conquer
- Climate.updateELA uses divide-and-conquer
- Glacier.getIceSpeed(x,z) doesn't reuse speed at x values
- Glacier.getIceSpeed(x,z) calls getIceThickness which does interpolation

MIGRATE TO PHETCOMMON:
- DoubleSpinner
- SliderOnlyLayoutStrategy
- HorizontalLayoutStrategy

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects

REJECTED:
5/8/08 - divide ice into separate shapes for above and below the ELA (OK to have one shape for entire surface, with overlaid shape of below ELA)
4/21/08 - optimize ice flow vectors, use same 1D grid as ice thickness (no, we need better precision)
4/15/08 - why does ablation curve back towards zero when elevation < 1000m? (problem went away)
4/15/08 - Climate model is very sensitive at "warm" end of scale, huge ELA jumps (Archie says this is accurate)
4/15/08 - add view of valley floor with rivers (this is part of the mountains.svg image file)
4/14/08 - my ELA values don't match those in Archie's python plots because he's using a grid, which is less accurate
2/28/08 - what happens when we hit "ice sheet" condition? (we'll set ranges so this can't happen)
2/27/08 - redesign advanced climate controls (feature was dropped)
2/27/08 - "Mass Balance" climate controls were dropped
2/27/08 - "age of ice" feature was dropped

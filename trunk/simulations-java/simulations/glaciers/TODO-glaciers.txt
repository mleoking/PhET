"To Do" list for "Glaciers" simulation
================================================================================

DESIGN ISSUES:
- toolbox allows creating multiple borehole drills
- borehole drill in different than the other things in the toolbox, all others are measurement devices
- will it be confusing that borehole drill disappears when it is released?
- move trash can out of toolbox?
- design for advanced climate controls has usability problems
- how does the "steady state" button work in the context of advanced climate controls?
- do graphs have zoom buttons, or do they autoscale? (issue for x & y axes)
- do graphs record data only while open, or are they always recording?
- how do we constrain tools that can only be dropped on (or off) the ice?
- what happens to an ice-specific (or atmosphere-specific) tool when the ice disappears (or appears) at its location?
- do tools need an origin indicator?
- layering order of tools and toolbox

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
- how to handle compressed vertical scale in context of shared PLayers?
- do we need a model-view transform?

HIGH PRIORITY:
- in ValleyNode, replace image with a GeneralPath that draws the shape of the valley floor
- redesign advanced climate controls
- remove tools by dragging them back to the trash can (or toolbox?)
- prototype drawing the valley, mountains and glacier
- implement glacier model

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- create graphs
- add unit tests for MVT "flip sign" feature
- get actual function that describes temperature as a function of altitude
- get actual function that describes precipiation as a function of altitude
- tools should not be draggable in top canvas
- fancy animation when a tool is dropped in the trash
- set foreground color of ticks & labels on BasicClimateControl sliders
- fix layout issues with various control panels
- make viewport automatically follow terminus whenever terminus is in the viewport
- add left and right arrows to zoom view, secondary viewport control
- tile the right edge of the valley, so that it can be exteneded when window is resized
- add variable caliper size to ice measuring tool

LOW PRIORITY:
- control panels in all modules should be the same height

COMMON CODE:

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects

DONE:

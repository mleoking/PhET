This document outlines the mathematical model behind the glacier
sim.  The calculations described are for a "Hollywood" model,
which was derived from the results of a finite-element glacier
model.  For that reason, the physical reasoning behind these
calculations is not apparent.

****************************************************************
A. mountain valley geometry

   The glacier behavior was modelled for a mountain valley with a
   particular geometry. Do not expect the models below to work
   with a very different mountain.  The elevation of the valley
   floor (F) as a function of horizontal distance (x) is given
   by:

   F = 4e3 - x/30. + exp(-(x-5e3)/800) 

****************************************************************
B. climate model

   The model's climate can be uniquely described with one value:
   the ela, which is a function of two variables (temp and snow)
   that are set by the user. The temp determines ablation, and
   snow determines accumulation; their difference is the mass
   balance. The elevation of zero mass balance is the ela.

1. temp is controlled by the sim user, and can be any value
   between 13 and 20

2. snow is controlled by the sim user, and can be any value
   between 0 and 1.5

3. given temp, the temperature versus elevation is given by

    temp - temp_lapse_rate*z

4. given temp and z, ablation is calculated by    

    temp_diff=(temp-modern_temp)
    min_ablation_elev= temp_diff*melt_v_temp + melt_z1

    if ( z > min_ablation_elev ):
        abl = 0
    else:
        abl = (melt_v_elev  * (1.-sin((z-melt_z0-
               temp_diff*melt_v_temp) / ((melt_z1-melt_z0)*2/pi)) ))
    offset = 5.5e-5*((temp_diff+9)**5) + 0.01*(temp_diff-9) + 0.3
    abl = abl + offset

5. given snow and z, accumulation is calculated by

    s = snow/1.5
    p0 = snow_max_elev - ((snow_max_elev-snow_min_elev)*s)
    pmax = snow_max*s
    tmp_ac = .5+(1./pi)* arctan((z-p0)/snow_transition_width)
    acc = pmax*tmp_ac

6. given abl and acc at any location, mass_balance is

    mass_balance = acc - abl

7. Given mass_balance at all elevations, ela is given by the
   elevation at which mass_balance=0 (or acc=abl).  The ela
   should be limited at some elevation above max_F (say, 8km).

8. initial climate should be
    temp = 19.0
    snow = 0.93

****************************************************************
C. steady state glacier model

   The glacier shape is described by its thickness as a function
   of x-position, H(x).  The glacier shape can be uniquely
   determined by a single value called the quasi-ela, qela.  The
   glacier is in steady state when the qela=ela.  This section
   describes how to compute H(x) for a given qela.
   
1. given qela, compute qelax by

    if qela < elax_x1:
        qelax = qela*elax_m0 + elax_b0
    elif qela < elax_x2:
        x = qela-elax_x1
        qelax = elax_y1 + elax_m0*x + elax_c3*(x**2) + elax_c4*(x**3)
    else:
        qelax = qela*elax_m2 + elax_b2

    minimum qelax is 0.0
   
2. given qelax, compute xterm (length of glacier) by

    xterm =  qelax / elax_terminus

3. given qelax, compute H_max (max thickness of glacier) by

    H_max = hmax_scale * sqrt(qelax)
   
4. given qela, xterm, and H_max, the thickness at any x (written
   here as H(x)) is gvien by

    x_peak = 0.5 * xterm
    if x < x_peak: 
        p = max(42-0.01*qela,1.5)
        r = 1.5*x_peak
        H(x) = sqrt(r**2 - (x-x_peak)**2) * H_max/r
        H(x) = H(x) * ( x_peak**p - (abs(x-x_peak)**p))/ (x_peak**p)
    else if x < xterm:
        H(x) = sqrt(x_peak**2 - (x-x_peak)**2) * H_max/x_peak
    else:
        H(x) = 0.0
 

****************************************************************
D. ice velocities

    For a given glacier thickness, H, the velocity of the ice at
    that position can be determined. Ice velocity is the sum of
    sliding velocity (constant u_slide) and deformation velocity.
    The deformation velocity is found by first computing the
    average deformation velocity (u_deform_ave), and then
    multiplying by a polynomial. 
    
1. given H at position x, u_deform_ave there is given by

    averageIceThicknessSquares = ave(H**2) over region of nonzero H
    u_deform_ave = H**2 * u_deform / averageIceThicknessSquares

2. given u_deform_ave at position x and vertical ice position zz,
   iceSpeed at this position is given by

    iceSpeed = u_slide + ( u_deform_ave*5*( zz - 1.5*zz**2 + zz**3 - 0.25*zz**4 ) )

****************************************************************
E. time-evolution of glacier

    If the ela is changed and does not coincide with the qela,
    the qela will evolve toward the ela, as given here.  There
    are some differences when the glacier is advancing (ela<qela)
    and when its retreating (ela>qela).

1. Set the timescale for evolution according to the ela:

    timescale =  -0.22*ela + 1026
    minimum timescale is 50
    maximum timescale is 200

2. Every timestep, if qela is not the same as ela (ie, the
   glacier is out of equilibrium) change the qela by delta_qela.
   (note the special treatment for an advancing glacier):

    if ( (abs(qela-ela) > ela_tolerance) and (qela<=max_F) ):
        delta_qela = (ela-qela)*( 1. - exp(-dt/timescale) )
        if (ela<qela):
            delta_qela = max( delta_qela, dt*q_advance_limit )
        else:
            delta_qela = min( delta_qela, dt*q_retreat_limit )
        if qela > elax_x2:
            delta_qela = delta_qela * elax_m0/elax_m2
        elif qela > elax_x1:
            delta_qela = delta_qela * (qela*acc_m + acc_b)
        qela = qela + delta_qela
    if ( qela > max_F):
        qela = max_F

3. The qela should no longer change when qela>max_F (this
   indicates that the glacier is completely gone),  as shown in
   the 'if' statment in part 2.

****************************************************************
F. fix for supercold climate

    If the climate is rapidly cooled, the ELA can temporarily be
    at an elevation lower than the instantaneous location of the
    terminus. In this case the glacier will rapidly grow and the
    terminus will soon pass the ELA.  But during the time when
    the ELA is below the terminus, an extra function must be
    added to the ice thickness (H) to indicate that accumulation
    is still taking place.  This extra function is called H_extra
    and is calculated here.

1. compute elax0, the x-position of the intersection of the
   valley floor and the ela

2. given xterm, H_max and elax0, H_extra is found by

    if x < elax0:
        H_extra = f_extra*H_max * ( 1 - (x-qelax)/(elax0-qelax) )
    else:
        H_extra = 0

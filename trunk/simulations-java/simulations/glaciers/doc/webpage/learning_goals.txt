Current Learning goals:

1. Describe how glaciers form, grow, and shrink -- specify what environmental
   conditions lead to each.
    a. Identify where net ablation (~melting>snowfall) and accumulation
       (~melting<snowfall) occur in relation to the Equilibrium Line Altitude
       (ELA).
    b. Explain or illustrate how glaciers form. 
    c. Describe the most important controls on mass balance in a glacier.
    d. Analyze the relationship between temperature and the likelihood of snow
       vs. rain at given parts of a glacier.
2. Explain how ice moves within a glacier (describe and illustrate the mass
   balance of a glacier).
    a. Describe and illustrate how glacial ice moves.
    b. Qualitatively describe the relationship between the speed of ice flow
       and ice thickness, and predict where ice is oldest.
3. Describe why and how valley glaciers "advance" or "retreat". 
    a. Compare and contrast motion of ice when a glacier is (1) at equilibrium,
       (2) advancing, and (3) retreating.
    b. Compare and contrast climatic conditions leading to glacial (1)
       equilibrium, (2) advance, and (3) retreat. 
4. Determine how multiple advance-retreat cycles affect the record of glacial
   moraines (end moraines).
    a. Describe how end moraines form.
    b. Discuss how more recent, large advances can impact moraines left by
       older, smaller advances.
    c. Given an illustration of 3-4 end moraines, determine the most likely
       order of their formation and justify your ordering.

# comments from Bob Anderson

Andrea and I spoke to Bob Anderson today for some much-needed
glaciologist input.

Bob was keen on getting some more controls for climate change.  We now
think we will include an option for the climate to follow the Earth's
historical climate of the last 750,000 years. We'd also like a
slightly more sophisticated climate change control (allowing, for
example, the climate to change and then remain constant, and for a
periodic climate). The large number of controls mean we should
probably go to a two-tab format, with the climate change controls
under an 'advanced' tab.

Bob also would like the sim to provide plots of various quantities
versus time, such as glacier length, a climate proxy (perhaps the
equilibrium line altitude), and temperature.

Bob considered erosion-modelling to be too problematic to implement in
the sim.  However, the valley floor should at least have some
parabolic shape.

# notes

- physics model needs short timestep (eg, 1 week)
- climate controls:
    - no altitude setting (would have to include tidewater glaciers)
    - want epochs LGM, modern, future (ICCC, ~2050)
    - follow dO18 record (750 kyr record)
    - have pure periodic climate
    - ramp control with end to see (measure?) time delay of glacier response to
      climate
- show plots (vs time) of 
    - climate proxy (eg ELA or dO18)
    - glacier length (with morain deposits?)
    - temp
- top of glacier should have 'feather' shape
- valley floor shape
    - typical erosion rate is mm/yr, but can be 10^4 times greater under glacier
    - let's have a realistic (parabolic) floor shape
    - let's not have erosion changing the floor shape

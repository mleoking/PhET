After discussion with Chris, it looks like the map view can be
replaced by a long zoomed-out view of the entire glacier valley.
I will work this into the mockup so we can talk about it.

I'll increase the font size.  I think the toolbox can be made smaller,
and the map view at the top should be smaller once the change above is
made, so that should buy us some space.

No, the toolbox does not need to move.

The valley shown is linear, and I think we can stick with the linear
shape, but I'll check with the glacier expert to make sure we don't
need other shapes. It would be nice to be able to change the value of
the linear slope, but that does not require much change at all (only
values on the coordinates and some effect in the equations of motion).

Will do.

I think we need the horizontal layout to maximize the amount of
glacier that is visible.  The 'set glacier to eq' button is not really
translatable to other sims, so there is no help from phetcommon there.

Typo corrected.

This button is not really a climate control, so I don't think it
should be in that box. It is more of a reset-type button.

I could use some better ideas here.  The intent is to be able to set
both (1) the climate at the present time and (2) how the climate will
evolve, if at all.  The defaults should be set to zero change, so that
the glacier responds directly to the user's manipulation of the
controls.  The user should also be able to, for example, go from the
climate at the Last Glacial Maximum (a period about 12000 years ago)
to the present-day conditions while watching the glacier's response.
The 'change' options could be hidden under and 'advanced options'
button, perhaps.  Or there could be a radio button that is set to
either 'constant climate' or 'change climate to...', where the
controls for climate change are greyed out if the first radio button
is selected. I have been struggling with how to offer this feature,
and could use any ideas (thanks to Sam M for what's there now).

I anticipate the valley floor being a simple linear slope. The ruler,
then, will only be measuring the distance down that slope.

Good idea.

Once the map view is changed (as per first point, above), there will
be no proprietary images.  I drew everything from scratch except for
the trashcan and the drill, which were taken from www.openclipart.org
(and everything there is strictly under 'Public Domain').

Hm, I don't know.  Any ideas from the group?

After some discussion with Chris, the following solution seems
reasonable. First, there will be no accomodations for a window size
smaller than 1024x768; the view will just be clipped. For increased
horizontal window size, the map-view will not change -- it will just
stay in the middle of the screen with grey area on the left and right.
The main view will show more of the valley when the window gets wider
(this may lead to part of the glacier going off-screen below or above
the view area, but the user will easily be able the pan the main view
to see those parts if s/he so desires). Increased window height will
only show more empty underground earth or empty sky.

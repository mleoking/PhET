The model for the glaciers sim is a "Hollywood" model.  
It attempts to approximate published data that described the behavior of glaciers.

Papers that served as the basic for this model can be found at:
http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/glaciers/webpage/

Papers include:

* Modeling topographic and climatic control of east-west asymmetry in 
  Sierra Nevada glacier length during the Last Glacial Maximum 
  (Mark Kessler, et al., Journal of Geophysical Research, 2006) 
  This paper has models for the ice velocity and precipitation.
  
* Features of glacial valley profiles simply explained
  (Bob Anderson, et al., Journal of Geophysical Research, 2006)
  This paper describes the equilibrium shape of glaciers.
  
* Chapter 7 of Bob Anderson's Geology Book
  This is a good resource for some of the basic ideas in glaciology.
  It has models for the viscous deformation of ice (part of the ice velocity model).

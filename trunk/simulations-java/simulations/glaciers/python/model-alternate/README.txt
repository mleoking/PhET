This is an alternative model that was NOT used in the glaciers sim.
It was developed by Archie Paulson and Mike Dubson.
The glacier is modeled as a set of "ice columns" that exchange mass.
Archie used this model to fine-tune the "Hollywood" model.

NOTE: I was never able to get this model to run on Mac OS X.
Running "ipython -pylab run01.py" results in many instances of this message:
"Warning: divide by zero encountered in double_scalars".

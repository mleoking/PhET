================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY:
- iterate on specification

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

LOW PRIORITY:

COMMON CODE:

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects

DONE:
11/14/07 - add stub for magnified view
11/14/07 - add drag handler to penguin, horizontally constrained
11/14/07 - add penguin as marker for which part of the valley we're zoomed in on
11/14/07 - remove example code
11/14/07 - stub for "birds eye view" of valley
11/14/07 - stubs for Climate Controls panel
11/14/07 - add icons to View controls
11/14/07 - add View controls (no icons)
11/14/07 - redo layout of clock control panel to have control over insets and justification (need to minimize space)
11/14/07 - first pass at clock control panel
11/14/07 - add a bunch of image files, extracted from SVG mockup
11/9/07 - move about.credits property to localization file

10/9/07 - migrate "Reset All" and "set minimum width" features to phetcommon ControlPanel
10/8/07 - migrate XML persistence manager to phetcommon
10/3/07 - fold GlobalConfig into GlaciersConfig
10/3/07 - rewrite persistence code in preparation for migration to phetcommon
10/3/07 - constants for localized strings in GlaciersPersistenceManager
10/1/07 - add example model element, node, and control panel for demonstration

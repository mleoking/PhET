"To Do" list for "Glaciers" simulation
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY:
- prototype the birds-eye and zoomed views
- forward toolbox drag events to newly-created model elements
- remove tools by dragging them back to the toolbox or to the trash can
- move trash can out of toolbox
- add controller package
- separate out controllers for toolbox and ThermometerNode
- create and continue dragging tool when you click on an icon in the toolbox
- implement all controls shown in design doc
- prototype the top and middle views

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- set foreground color of ticks & labels on BasicClimateControl sliders

LOW PRIORITY:
- control panels in all panels should be the same height

COMMON CODE:

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects

Glaciers, version 0.00.09
</b></big></big>
<p>
English: <a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
<p>
Spanish: <a href="glaciers_es.jnlp">Glaciares</a>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>remove "Mass Balance" climate controls (feature dropped)
<li>remove "ice age" checkbox from View controls (feature dropped)
<li>add very basic mountains, 1000 meters above valley floor, so we can see when "ice sheet" condition occurs
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>x-axis autoscales for graphs, which may not be desirable in the final product
<li>with range of climate controls, glacier is longer than 80km, ELA can be outside of top view, etc.
<li>equilbrium line should be shown only where it intersects the ice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lots of things are not implemented. Here are some of them:
<li>no view of ice velocities
<li>Once created, tools cannot be dragged deleted (no trash can feature).
<li>Perspective view is not implemented; both views show a side view of the scene.
<li>Snowfall is not visible.
<li>There are no left/right arrows in the zoomed view for moving the viewport.
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/TODO-glaciers.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

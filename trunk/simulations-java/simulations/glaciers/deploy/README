</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>first pass at "ice flow vectors" feature
<li>increase steepness of valley headwall
<li>use custom paints and strokes for curves in "glacial budget vs. elevation" graph
<li>change "v." to "vs." in all graphs
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>equilibrium line should be shown only where it intersects the ice
<li>tools can be lost by dragging them outside the birds-eye view
<li>view of mountains is a proxy image, to be replaced with a better representation
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>marker flags do not move with glacier
<li>borehole drill doesn't work
<li>tools cannot be dragged to the trash
<li>3D perspective is not implemented; both views show a 2D cross-section
<li>snowfall is not visible.
<li>There are no left/right arrows in the zoomed view for moving the viewport.
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
<li>ice measurement tool doesn't resize its calipers
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>nothing is drawn to the right of x=80km
<li>zoomed viewport doesn't automatically scroll to follow terminus
<li>no Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers
<li>no textures or debris moving in the ice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/CHANGES.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

<p>
English: <a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
<p>
Spanish: <a href="glaciers_es.jnlp">Glaciares</a>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>zoomed viewport stay vertically centered on valley floor
<li>added Mass Balance climate controls
<li>added Graph controls, for testing purposes
<li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Know issues:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Most things don't do anything interesting because the model is very incomplete.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lots of things are not implemented. Here are some of them:
<li>Once created, tools cannot be dragged deleted (no trash can feature).
<li>Perspective view is not implemented; both views show a side view of the scene.
<li>There is no model for the glacier, so no glacier will form, and the tools that are related to ice (ice thickness tool, glacial budget meter) will do nothing.
<li>There is no model for the climate, so temperature is inaccurate, and there is no snowfall.
<li>There is no model for the mountain range, so you won't see mountains.
<li>There are no left/right arrows in the zoomed view for moving the viewport.
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/TODO-glaciers.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

Glaciers, version 0.00.06
</b></big></big>
<p>
English: <a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
<p>
Spanish: <a href="glaciers_es.jnlp">Glaciares</a>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fix glacial budget meter, it should use the meter's elevation, not the valley floor elevation
<li>change climate control panels to support new climate model
<li>change "Snowfall & Temperature" controls to: snowfall, snowfall reference elevation, sea-level temperature
<li>change "Mass Balance" controls to: max snowfall, ELA
<li>make all climate controls sliders, with editable textfield
<li>implement conversions from ELA to temperature and snowfall reference elevation
<li>disable ELA slider so we can see ELA range (there are circularity problems with mapping between the 2 climate domains)
<li>display equilibrium line as a dashed horizontal that spans the play area (temporary representation)
<li>fix -0 (negative zero) displays
<li>display elevation and distance with precision=1, all other quantities with precision=0.1
<li>fix some control panel layout problems (still not perfect)
<li>update climate continuously while dragging sliders, performance is OK
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>with range of climate controls, glaciers is way longer than our desired 80km
<li>ELA control is read-only due to circularities that occur when mapping between 2 climate domains
<li>equilbrium line should be shown only where it intersects the ice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lots of things are not implemented. Here are some of them:
<li>no view of ice velocities
<li>Once created, tools cannot be dragged deleted (no trash can feature).
<li>Perspective view is not implemented; both views show a side view of the scene.
<li>Snowfall is not visible.
<li>There is no model for the mountain range, so you won't see mountains.
<li>There are no left/right arrows in the zoomed view for moving the viewport.
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/TODO-glaciers.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

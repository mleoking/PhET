<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lots of things are not implemented. Here are some of them:
<li>no view of ice velocities
<li>Once created, tools cannot be dragged deleted (no trash can feature).
<li>Perspective view is not implemented; both views show a side view of the scene.
<li>Snowfall is not visible.
<li>There is no model for the mountain range, so you won't see mountains.
<li>There are no left/right arrows in the zoomed view for moving the viewport.
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
</ul>

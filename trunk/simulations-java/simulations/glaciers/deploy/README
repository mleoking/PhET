<p>
English: <a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
<p>
Spanish: <a href="glaciers_es.jnlp">Glaciares</a>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>allow equilibrium line to be at x < 0
<li>added ice thickness and ice velocity to glacier model
<li>added view of ice thickness
<li>glacier goes immediately to steady-state when climate changes (no time dependence)
<li>climate is not changed until temperature or snowfall sliders are released
<li>ice thickness tool display correct thickness value, but calipers aren't resized
<li>glacial budget meter displays correct values
<li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Lots of things are not implemented. Here are some of them:
<li>new climate model received on 2/8/08
<li>no view of ice velocities
<li>Once created, tools cannot be dragged deleted (no trash can feature).
<li>Perspective view is not implemented; both views show a side view of the scene.
<li>Snowfall is not visible.
<li>There is no model for the mountain range, so you won't see mountains.
<li>There are no left/right arrows in the zoomed view for moving the viewport.
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/TODO-glaciers.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

<p>
Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fix timescale model: change max timescale to 200, use the same timescale model for receding and advancing glaciers
<li>add randomness to ice surface ripples.  They are created at random time intervals (20-100 years), and with random lengths (50-180m)
<li>distribute features between Introduction and Advanced tabs
<li>hide some features (Experiments tab, English/metric, Save/Load, time-based graphs, Help)
<li>close dialogs when switching tabs, restore their state when switching back
<li>keep track of dialog positions, always reopen dialog where it was previously
<li>many internal framework changes related to controller
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>glacier starts up in steady state, but with no debris or ripple in the ice, and no moraine
<li>registration points (small red circles and blue dots) are shown in the background image
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>y axis needs to be scaled by 2x
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>Experiments tab
<li>Englis/metric units control
<li>time-based graphs
<li>Save/Load
<li>Help
</ul>
<p>

Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>add yaw (rotation about the vertical axis) to our fake 3D perspective.  
Modifications required to ice, ripples, debris and equilibrium line.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>background image has valley narrower near the headwall, so ice shape doesn't line up with far side of valley
<li>as ELA moves above terminus for an advancing glacier, shape of surface below ELA is briefly incorrect
<li>ripples don't seem to be uniformly distributed, more of them are closer to the viewer
<li>full-size background image is so large that it exceeds JVM heap space and causes OutOfMemoryException
<li>model of valley floor is a rough approximation of background image for x<0
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>glacier starts up in steady state, but with no debris or ripple in the ice, and no moraine
<li>registration points (small red circles and blue dots) are shown in the background image
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Experiments tab
<li>English/metric units control
<li>time-based graphs
<li>Save/Load
<li>Help
</ul>

<p>
Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>new timescale model
<li>new ice thickness model
<li>fixes to climate model (ablation and melt_z1 were wrong)
<li>add empty panels for "Advance" and "Climate Experiments"
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>problems with the new model, including:
<li>at default climate settings, steady state glacier looks odd, ELA is very high
<li>ELA is at the thickest part of the ice, so no debris ever reaches the surface
<li>factor that limits the rate of glacier advancement has a problem that cause glacier to evolve in the wrong direction when ELA goes above the headwall
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>can't switch between English and metric units
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>features need to be split into Basic, Advanced, and Climate Experiments panels
<li>interface for climate experiments is not implemented
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

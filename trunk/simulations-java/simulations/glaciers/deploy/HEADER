Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>remove alignment points from background image
<li>make ice ripples slightly darker so that they can be seen more easily when snowfall is visible
<li>more uniform distribution of ripples across the ice surface
<li>convert picture of real glacier from PNG to JPEG, reduced size from 650KB to 55KB
<li>fix: shape for ice surface below ELA was missing the terminus point when the terminus is very close to the ELA
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>description (aka abstract) is missing from About dialog
<li>background image has valley narrower near the headwall, so ice shape doesn't line up with far side of valley
<li>full-size background image is so large that it exceeds JVM heap space and causes OutOfMemoryException
<li>model of valley floor is a rough approximation of background image for x<0
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>glacier starts up in steady state, but with no debris or ripple in the ice, and no moraine
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>

<li>Experiments tab
<li>English/metric units control
<li>time-based graphs
<li>Save/Load
<li>Help

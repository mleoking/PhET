<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>draw equilibrium line across valley floor when terminus is above ELA
<li>swap colors for ice surface and cross-section
<li>move origin indicator on thermometer to be vertically aligned with bottom of bulb
<li>first pass at dragging tools to the trash (doesn't work on initial drag that creates the tool)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>tools can be lost by dragging them outside the birds-eye view
<li>ice should use different colors above/below the equilibrium line
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>marker flags do not move with glacier
<li>borehole drill doesn't work
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
<li>ice measurement tool doesn't resize its calipers
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>zoomed viewport doesn't automatically scroll to follow terminus
<li>no Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers
<li>no textures or debris moving in the ice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

</b></big></big>
<p>
Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>locate the terminus more precisely, instead of rounding to nearest dx
<li>locate point where ELA intersects the ice surface more precisely, instead of rounding to nearest dx
<li>compute ice thickness values on demand for specfic x values, instead of trying to interpolate between pre-computed samples; same performance, more precise results, simplified code
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>at default climate settings, steady state glacier looks odd, ELA is very high
<li>in general, ELA doesn't look right
<li>when ELA is below terminus, the drawn ELA jumps around a bit when the terminus reaches the ELA
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>can't switch between English and metric units
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>features need to be split into Intro, Advanced, and Climate Experiments panels
<li>interface for climate experiments is not implemented
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

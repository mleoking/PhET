<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>simplified and rewrote climate model (temperature and snowfall)
<li>removed control for snowfall reference elevation
<li>added end moraine model, prune debris that overlaps at the end moraine
<li>liquid in thermometer changes based on temperature
<li>added snowfall check box (not hooked up)
<li>added English/metric units radio buttons (not hooked up)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>debris is appearing on the glacier's surface above the ELA, model problem
<li>glacier advances too rapidly, model problem
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>can't switch between English and metric units
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>features need to be split into Basic, Advanced, and Experiments panels
<li>interface for climate experiments in not implemented
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

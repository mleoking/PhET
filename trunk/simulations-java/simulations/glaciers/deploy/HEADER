English: <a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>

Spanish: <a href="glaciers_es.jnlp">Glaciares</a>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>model fix for negative glacier length
<li>model fix for negative max ice thickness
<li>model fix for negative ice thickness
<li>align and scale image of mountains and valley
<li>prevent center of zoomed viewport from being dragged any farther right than 80km
<li>increase precision of temperature and snowfall text fields
<li>change colors in Glacial Budget chart (to match Archie's plots)
<li>show ablation as -ablation in charts (to match Archie's plots)
<li>fix ablation model so that it never goes to zero
<li>show ice velocity vectors in zoomed view only, they clutter the birds-eye view
<li>add development-only display of ELA value (to right of toolbox)
<li>limit ELA to max of 8000 meters
<li>reduce stroke width of coordinate axes
<li>reuse some objects in model & view of ice velocity to improve performance
<li>reorganize ice model for improved readability and maintainability
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>when ice velocity vectors are visible, sim runs slower
<li>equilibrium line should be shown only where it intersects the ice
<li>tools can be lost by dragging them outside the birds-eye view
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>marker flags do not move with glacier
<li>borehole drill doesn't work
<li>tools cannot be dragged to the trash
<li>3D perspective is not implemented; both views show a 2D cross-section
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>There are no left/right arrows in the zoomed view for moving the viewport.
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
<li>ice measurement tool doesn't resize its calipers
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>zoomed viewport doesn't automatically scroll to follow terminus
<li>no Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers
<li>no textures or debris moving in the ice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/CHANGES.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>add motion model for tracer flags
<li>add framework for disabling specific tool behaviors while they are being dragged
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>tracer flags are not crushed by advancing glacier
<li>tools can be lost by dragging them outside the birds-eye view
<li>ice should use different colors above/below the equilibrium line
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>ice has no texture, so you can't see it moving
<li>tools have no drag constraints
<li>borehole drill doesn't work
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
<li>ice measurement tool doesn't resize its calipers
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>zoomed viewport doesn't automatically scroll to follow terminus
<li>no Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers

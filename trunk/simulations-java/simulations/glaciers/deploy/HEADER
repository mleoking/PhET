Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>snowfall view: Drawn as a gradient that fills the atmosphere in the birds-eye view. Snowfall tapers off linearly down to 1500m. Above 4800m, "white out" occurs when snowfall is at max.
<li>fixed "Reset All" feature, disabled since 0.00.32
<li>hide icons for "coordinates" and "ice flow" check boxes in Intro tab
<li>verified that all feature for July 25 milestone work properly when clock is paused
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>full-size background image is so large that it exceeds JVM heap space and causes OutOfMemoryException
<li>model of valley floor doesn't match background image for x<0, as can be seen when "snowfall" is checked
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>glacier starts up in steady state, but with no debris or ripple in the ice, and no moraine
<li>registration points (small red circles and blue dots) are shown in the background image
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Experiments tab
<li>English/metric units control
<li>time-based graphs
<li>Save/Load
<li>Help
</ul>

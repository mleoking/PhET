<li>#1051, add model fix for glacier retreating too fast near headwall (q_retreat_limit)
<li>#999, attempt to smooth out bump in glacier length vs time curve, better but still problematic between elax_x2 and elax_x1
<li>#998, autoscale y-axis of the "Glacier Length vs Time" graph, set min autoscale range to 0-3km
</ul>
<b>Known problems (see Unfuddle for complete list):</b>

<li>#766 ice should accumulate above ELA, even below glacier terminus
<li>#999 bump in "Glacier Length vs Time" curve
</ul>

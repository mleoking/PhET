Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>trash can is no longer visible in the toolbox (easy to make it visible, if desired)
<li>put tools away by dragging them back to the toolbox
<li>change layout of View control panel so that more of Zoomed view is visible
<li>fixed flags that we getting stuck on the valley floor
<li>adjusted random "fall over" angle for flags
<li>fixed debris that was getting created on the valley floor and thought it was at the moraine
<li>borehole drill can no longer be dragged by its "fire" button
<li>generate debris in the entire cross section, not just above ELA
<li>workaround for q_advance_limit problem, to prevent qela from evolving towards higher elevations forever
<li>renamed "Basic" panel to "Introduction"
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>at default climate settings, steady state glacier looks odd, ELA is very high
<li>in general, ELA doesn't look right
<li>when ELA is below terminus, the drawn ELA jumps around a bit when the terminus reaches the ELA
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>can't switch between English and metric units
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>features need to be split into Intro, Advanced, and Climate Experiments panels
<li>interface for climate experiments is not implemented
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/CHANGES.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>when dragging glacier, it will remain "stuck" to the surface of the glacier or valley floor if the mouse is 100m above or below the surface. Outside this range, you can drag it around freely.
<li>glacial budget meter displays "?" when its not on the surface of the glacier or valley floor
<li>if glacial budget meter is stuck to the surface of the glacier, it will remain on the surface as the glacier evolves
<li>remove "elevation" from glacial budget meter
<li>integrate new image and text into "glacier picture" feature
<li>add moving "ripples" to glacier surface, ala design document
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>debris is appearing on the glacier's surface above the ELA, model problem
<li>glacier advances too rapidly, model problem
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>ice doesn't appear to move
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>features need to be split into Basic and Advanced panels
<li>no Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/CHANGES.txt?view=markup">"to do" list</a>

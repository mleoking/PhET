</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>add left & right scroll arrows to zoomed view
<li>equilibrium line ends at x=0 when ELA > F(0)
<li>equilibrium line follows contour of glacier as it evolves
<li>first pass at ice extrusion
<li>add elevation to glacial budget meter
<li>use same colors in glacial budget meter and "Glacial Budget vs Elevation" chart
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>tools can be lost by dragging them outside the birds-eye view
<li>ice should use different colors above/below the equilibrium line
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>marker flags do not move with glacier
<li>borehole drill doesn't work
<li>tools cannot be dragged to the trash
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
<li>ice measurement tool doesn't resize its calipers
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>zoomed viewport doesn't automatically scroll to follow terminus
<li>no Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers
<li>no textures or debris moving in the ice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

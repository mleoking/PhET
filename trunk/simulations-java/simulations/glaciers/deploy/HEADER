<li>added 3D model of debris, appear at random 3D locations in ice cross-section above the ELA
<li>added visualize of debris (small boulders)
<li>debris forms a moraine at the terminus
<li>delete debris that is covered by advancing glacier
<li>borehole drill is larger, aligned so that boreholes are drilled at the tip of the drill bit

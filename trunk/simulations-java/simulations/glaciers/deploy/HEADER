Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>new background image: y axis stretched 2x, more of valley visible to left of headwall, improve colors, add 3D cues, reduce height of mountains to show more peaks
<li>make y-axis twice as tall (increase model-view-transform y-axis scale by 2x)
<li>zoom out on the birds-eye view by 2x so that the valley floor is visible for x=0 to x=80km 
<li>show more of the valley that is to the left of the headwall in the birds-eye view
<li>remove tools from the birds-eye view, they are now too small to be usable
<li>only draw the x-axis coordinate view for x >= 0 (our model of the valley floor doesn't match the background image for x < 0)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>background image is so large that it exceeds JVM heap space and causes OutOfMemoryException
<li>"Steady State" button doesn't advance clock time
<li>glacier starts up in steady state, but with no debris or ripple in the ice, and no moraine
<li>registration points (small red circles and blue dots) are shown in the background image
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>Experiments tab
<li>English/metric units control
<li>time-based graphs
<li>Save/Load
<li>Help
</ul>

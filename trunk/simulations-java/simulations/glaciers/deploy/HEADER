Click to launch English version:
<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>create separate geometry for ice surface below ELA
<li>add textures to ice (cross-section, surface above ELA, surface below ELA)
<li>make flags drop to valley floor when glacier recedes
<li>add icons for View check boxes (equilibrium line, ice flow, coordinates)
<li>change size of ice perspective to more closely match valley width in image
<li>first pass at animating tools that are dropped in trash (they shrink to disappear)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li>tracer flags are not crushed by advancing glacier
<li>tools can be lost by dragging them outside the birds-eye view
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>ice texture doesn't move
<li>tools have no drag constraints
<li>borehole drill doesn't work
<li>snowfall is not visible
<li>Advanced panel is hidden; what you see is the Basic panel.
<li>ice measurement tool doesn't resize its calipers
<li>time-based graphs are not implemented
<li>zoomed viewport doesn't automatically scroll to follow terminus
<li>no Help menu option to show pictures of real glaciers
<li>no textures or debris moving in the ice
</ul>
<p>
<b>Remaining work:</b>

<ul>
<li><a href="glaciers.jnlp">Glaciers</a>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>[730] stretch x-axis so that 80km fills most of the birds-eye view
<li>[730] change default snowfall to 0.93m (was 0.95m) so that entire default glacier fits in zoomed viewport at new x-axis scale
<li>[750] make borehole drill draggable by fire button
<li>[733] increase glacial budget meter snap threshold to 1.5x (was 100m, changed to 150 meters)
<li>[733] make glacial budget meter snap to glacier surface (or valley surface) when released, ala tracer flags
<li>[733] make glacial budget meter snap to valley floor and show values for x<0 ,like it does for x>=0
<li>[732] change glacier picture button to use text "Show glacier picture"
<li>add tools to birds-eye view
<li>fix: Reset All does not reset viewport position
<li>fix: Save should save zoomed viewport position
<li>reposition sample help items so they don't overlap any controls
<li>add help item for toolbox node in zoomed viewport
</ul>
<p>
<b>Not implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>Experiments tab
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems (see Unfuddle for complete list):</b>
<ul>
<li>[725] finalize Help items
<li>[726] flags and debris on glacier surface stop advancing when glacier is retreating
<li>[727] glacier growth from zero length still takes a long time, and then speeds up
<li>[728] change color of glacier cross-section
<li>[729] "steady state" feature needs to fill glacier with debris and surface ripples
<li>[731] change label on steady state button
</ul>

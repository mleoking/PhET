Fixed the size of the rulers in the water tower tab
Fixed: Velocity sensor should read out water velocity
Fixed: water drops should have size based on water volume, so low trickle is lots of drops.
Fixed: water should look less particulate
Fixed: water drops should be absorbed when they hit the ground
Wired up faucet manual slider to model
Fixed: decrease in volume should be proportional to water velocity
Improved water faucet model
Wired up faucet buttons to model
Made water velocity vary as v=sqrt(2*g*h)
Made water only leak out when hole uncovered
Refactored properties to be public final and removed 'property' from field names
Improved covering panel
Added a drag handle on top of the water tower to change its vertical location
Improvements for water-tower module to look more like mock-up
Added initial support for panel covering
Added initial support for faucet in water-tower module
# 0.00.08 (48319) Jan 28, 2011
Made it so that the pipes can't be dragged offscreen vertically
Made it so that the pipe control point can't be dragged offscreen vertically
Show second pressure sensor at a y location that yields a different pressure value
Hide the balloons
Fixed: units control panel background is incorrect
Don't show any particles near the edges, since their velocity should be zero in physical reality (or a full-blown fluid dynamics simulation)
Use new graphics for pressure sensor node
Added 3 patch image node for pressure sensor
replace incomplete "Reset All" node with ResetAllButtonNode
Use PropertyRadioButton in UnitsControlPanel
Added a grab handle to control the y offset of the input and output pipes
Added a dot icon to the "more" controls in the dots control slider label
Fixed initial location of dropper control
Use dropper control from membrane channels
Improved location for dot flow control
Fixed: make sure pipe top doesn't go below pipe bottom
Separated dots flow control from dropper
Fluid Flow: improved initial sensor locations
Made pipe curve continuously instead of linear
Moved spline computations from phetcommon to common/spline since it depends on Jama
Moved spline computations from energy-skate-park to phetcommon for reuse in fluid-pressure-and-flow
Added balloons
Simplified context interface for PressureSensor model
# 0.00.06 (46993) Dec 8, 2010
Fixed: Possible to deselect units radio buttons
Fixed: fluid color should change with density - fade to amber for honey, gray for gasoline.
Fixed: the first (zero) tick mark of the ruler should be at the very end, see #2604
Fixed: Ruler checkbox does not change selected when pressing ruler close button
Improved sensor nodes so they have an attached triangle tip pointing to the sensor hot spot
Moved velocity vector arrow behind the sensor triangle hot spot
Add a background to sensor nodes to make them look more sensory
Created class hierarchy for sensor nodes
Move value property into Sensor base class
Added units to velocity sensor, cleaned up VelocitySensorNode and PressureSensorNode
Added a "close" button to the ruler
Removed dropper "drop" button
Removed time readout
Moved pool height readout to the side
Removed phet logo from control panel based on CM's recommendation
Use phetcommon text for "reset all" string
Fixed: sensor nodes occluded by control panel
Fixed: Fluid Density button and associated control fall off left edge of play area
Added water tower and water drops
Factored out RelativeDragHandler
# 0.00.05 (46345) Nov 18, 2010
Fixed: Pipe top and bottom edges in wrong z-ordering
# 0.00.04 (46343) Nov 18, 2010
Fixed: Fluid density slider should change fluid color
Fixed: pipe grab handles can get dissociated from the mouse
Fixed: particles should fit within pipe
Fixed: velocity and pressure hot spots are different sizes
Fixed: colored fluid not being removed from model/view
converted from Function<T,Void> to VoidFunction<T>
# 0.00.03 (46334) Nov 18, 2010
Fixed: Multiple clocks are running, caused by wiring up to new clock control panel
Fixed: Second tab clock always running
Fluid-flow: Fixed locations of sensors on startup so they display good initial values
Fluid-flow: Fixed crash on reset all
Show 0.9999 atm when lifted into the atmosphere so students don't think pressure doesn't decrease vs altitude
Fluid-flow: Moved grab handles to front layer
Fluid-flow: Restart clock on reset
Fluid-flow: Fixed: Reset all crashes the sim if particles are present
# 0.00.02 (46303) Nov 17, 2010

Fixed: velocity and pressure hot spots are different sizes
Fixed: colored fluid not being removed from model/view
converted from Function<T,Void> to VoidFunction<T>
# 0.00.03 (46334) Nov 18, 2010
Fixed: Multiple clocks are running, caused by wiring up to new clock control panel
Fixed: Second tab clock always running
Fluid-flow: Fixed locations of sensors on startup so they display good initial values
Fluid-flow: Fixed crash on reset all
Show 0.9999 atm when lifted into the atmosphere so students don't think pressure doesn't decrease vs altitude
Fluid-flow: Moved grab handles to front layer
Fluid-flow: Restart clock on reset
Fluid-flow: Fixed: Reset all crashes the sim if particles are present

Wired up faucet manual slider to model
Fixed: decrease in volume should be proportional to water velocity
Improved water faucet model
Wired up faucet buttons to model

Made it so that the pipe control point can't be dragged offscreen vertically
Show second pressure sensor at a y location that yields a different pressure value
Hide the balloons
Fixed: units control panel background is incorrect
Don't show any particles near the edges, since their velocity should be zero in physical reality (or a full-blown fluid dynamics simulation)
Use new graphics for pressure sensor node
Added 3 patch image node for pressure sensor
replace incomplete "Reset All" node with ResetAllButtonNode
Use PropertyRadioButton in UnitsControlPanel
Added a grab handle to control the y offset of the input and output pipes

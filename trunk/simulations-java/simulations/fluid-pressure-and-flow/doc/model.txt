Pressure tab:

When underwater, pressure is getStandardAirPressure() + liquidDensity.get() * gravity.get() * abs( -y );
When above water, pressure is a linear function based on y=0 has one standard air pressure and y=500 ft = earth air pressure at 500ft according to http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-altitude-pressure-d_462.html

EARTH_AIR_PRESSURE = 101325 Pa
EARTH_AIR_PRESSURE_AT_500_FT = 99490;
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure

LEARNING GOALS
pressure at depth h is given by: p = p0 + rho g h
water pressure increases linearly with depth
air pressure decreases with altitude
water pressure at the top of water equals air pressure at the same
pressure doesn't change as you move horizontally through a fluid
water pressure increases linearly with fluid density
water pressure increases linearly with gravity

Flow Tab:

The fluid is treated as incompressible, so the flow rate must remain constant throughout the pipe,
Hence flux = rate / area, and rate = flux * area, where the rate of fluid flow is measured in volume (m^3) per second

Friction slows down particles closer to the edges of the pipe, but not to zero at the edge, otherwise an infinite amount of particles would pile up at the corners.
Instead the flow rate falls off quadratically near the edges

LEARNING GOALS
p + 0.5 rho v^2 + rho g y = constant (16-17 = bernoulli's equation)
Objects move faster when passageway is constricted
Pressure is lower when passageway is constricted
Fluid is conserved, just redistributed based on container dimensions (continuity equation)
Learning goals from Tab 1 still apply under fluid flow

Water tower tab:

Water flows in through the top faucet and out through the hole in the water tower (if open), which may connect to a hose
The speed of the water coming out is sqrt( 2 * g * h ), where h is the distance between the output point of the water and the top of the water

LEARNING GOALS:
1.  torricelli's theorem v = sqrt(2gh), see http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/bernoul.htm
See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli's_law
This learning goal also includes the subgoals v = f(g,h) and  v!=f(rho, y)
2. p + 0.5 rho v^2 + rho g y = constant (16-17 = bernoulli's equation), mostly as it pertains to torricelliâ€™s theorem

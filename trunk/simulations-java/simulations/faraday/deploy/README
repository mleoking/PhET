Faraday's Electromagnetic Lab, version 1.05.04
</b></big></big>
<p>
<b>What's new:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>relabel "AC Power Supply" to "AC Current Supply"
<li>recalibrate bulb rays, voltmeter and electron motion to account for max loop area increase in version 1.05.03
<li>use fixed sample point spacing (based on magnet height) for pickup coil in "Pickup Coil" and "Transformer" panels,
reduces sudden bursts of current when magnet is dragged vertically inside pickup coil
<li>change model shape of Electromagnet from a circle to a square
</ul>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>when dragging magnet through pickup coil, there will be a sudden burst of current when 
the coil's sample points move from inside the magnet to outside (or visa versa)
</ul>

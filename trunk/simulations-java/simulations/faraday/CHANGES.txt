REJECTED:
(2/7/07) - bug: direction of electron movement is wrong "Pickup Coil" module (not a problem, Mike Dubson verified) 
(?) - add a graph of field strength over time to the Field Meter (unnecessary)
(4/25/05) - use offscreen buffering (no improvement/05)
(4/25/05) - disable rectangle computations and use paintImmediately (no improvement)
(4/24/05) - use a variable-step clock with median filtering of dt (lightbulb & voltmeter don't look cyclic, they jump around)
(4/24/05) - optimize electrons (their performance hit is negligible compared to grid)
(4/24/05) - calculate periods of Generator and AC so that delta flux is zero/max at correct point (no, handle this in Lightbulb)
(4/22/05) - simplified expressions in DipoleMagnet.getStrengthInside (already optimal, no trig functions)
(4/22/05) - get rid of the amplitude stuff in AbstractVoltageSource and AbstractCoil (document it clearly)
(4/19/05) - glitch in the B-field when approaching the electromagnet coil from above or below (this is physically correct)
(4/12/05) - replace EasyGridBagLayout with SwingUtils.addGridBagComponent (no, SwingUtils version is inadequate)
(4/12/05) - fix PhetShapeGraphic.contains so that stroke width is taken into account (compass is now flattened to an image)
(4/8/05) - make wiggle me's fade out instead of blinking off (no one asked for this, different than other sims)
(4/6/05) - put compass in top layer so it doesn't get hidden behind larger objects (compass needs to move through coil)
(4/5/05) - lightbulb flashes the first time that you visit each module (Carl likes this, leave it in)
(4/4/05) - eliminate AffineTransform from BarMagnet.getStrength(Point2D) and PickupCoil.updateEmf (not possible)
(4/4/05) - add scaling of pixel-space (not necessary, but would be done in DipoleMagnet.getStrengthInside)
(3/29/05) - draw needles using Graphics.fillPolygon (no performance improvement)
(3/29/05) - transparent bar magnet layer so that field meter looks like it's inside it (no one except Ron asked for this feature)
(3/29/05) - redo Turbine model, it should not extend BarMagnet (fine as is for this simulation)
(3/24/05) - cache grid needles at N-degree angles to eliminate rotation transform (rotation is not the problem, fill is the problem)
(3/24/05) - draw grid needles as images instead of shapes (no improvement using images)
(3/24/05) - explicitly set the initial capacity (# coordinates) in the compass needle paths (no performance improvement)

(3/16/05) - collision detection in Generator & Transformer modules (fine as is)

(2/17/05) - change sliders to "ModelSlider" used by other simulations (No - not used by many others, has problems)
(2/15/05) - encapulate all rescaling of emf into one place (already encapsulated in Rescaler)
(2/10/05) - PickupCoilGraphic leaves screen turds (ApparatusPanel2 problem)
(2/10/05) - make lightbulb ramp up/down instead of immediate on/off (looks fine as is)
(2/7/05) - repaint compass grid when background color changes, in case we're switching rendering strategies (no longer necessary)
(1/28/05) - use offscreen buffering in apparatus panel to remove screen turds? (found GraphicLayerSet problem)

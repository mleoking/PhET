Would it be harder to show the sweater (and eventually balloons as
well) with the positive and negative charges mixed up uniformly
together before the rubbing instead of being right on top of each
other?  Guessing at the algorithim you are using, I suspect it might
be, but I thought I would ask. Another alternative is to just have
them still locked together, but offset a bit in the display to give the
same effect.

How about putting the balloons on strings, so that they are free to repel each other...
Could fix drawing problem by synchronizing, or by double buffering.  Double buffering doesn't fix--may be a sync problem.  How to synchronize on an object?
Using JAI to patch the balloon picture's background.

It may be faster to run image ops on the client machine than to download two similar images.

Units are indicated through the source code.

Units used in the model:

    time = sec
    position, distance = nm
    power = mW
    intensity = mW/nm^2
    force = pN
    viscosity = Pa*s
    velocity, speed = nm/sec
    acceleration = nm/sec^2
    temperature = Kelvin
    angles = radians
    potential energy = mJ

Some useful units conversions:

    force: N = newton = ( kg * m ) / sec^2

    pressure: Pa = pascal = N / m^2

    energy: J = joule = ( kg * m^2 ) / sec^2

    power: W = watt = ( kg * m^2 ) / sec^3 = J / s

Some useful SI prefixes:

    kilo  = 1E3
    milli = 1E-3
    micro = 1E-6
    nano  = 1E-9
    pico  = 1E-12
    femto = 1E-15

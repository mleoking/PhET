-===============================================================================
"To Do" list for "Optical Tweezers" simulation
================================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

AAPT:
- when not in slow clock mode, always run E-field model using a dt that makes the field look like it's moving too fast to make sense of
- when user drags bead, auto-release if DNA extension is 97% of contour length
- adjust clock time display and units as dt is changed
- position histogram requires more precision for x-axis and ruler
- add description to About dialog
- set correct ranges for slow and fast time scales
- set correct default values for everything, including developer controls

HIGH PRIORITY:


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- enable/disable controls based on clock speed
- what units for E-field?
- tune developer controls, pick appropriate defaults
- rail slider for laser?
- vertical laser toggle button: http://www.bigstockphoto.com/thumbs/6/3/3/medium/336571.jpg
- dialogs don't repaint or close immediately when clock is running, thread priority?

LOW PRIORITY:
- reduce vertical spacing of control panels (if necessary, after features/layout has stabilized)
- bug: beep sometimes occurs when selecting vacuum with fluid controls dialog open
- DNA strand looks too straight initially, evolve a few times before displaying?
- visible seams where symmetrical pieces of laser beam gradient are stitched together
- show DNA strand as a double helix?
- control panels have vertical scrollbars
- make developer controls savable/loadable?
- position histogram should make an observation every N seconds, not every clock tick (?)
- when subdividing dt in bead motion algorithm, motion will be different than displayed vectors
- use TrigCache to improve performance?
- save/load configurations
- javadoc
- package level javadoc
- make laser danger sign look better
- Spanish translations
- remove code for "Show change in momentum model" if we don't implement it 
- improve startup performance

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output
- optimize memory management by reusing mutable objects

MIGRATE TO COMMON:
- PolarCartesianConverter
- Vector2DNode

REJECTED:
6/29/07 - are there any cases where DNA strand's extension length exceeds contour length? (no, not after constraining drag)
6/28/07 - make "beam" the only laser display option in fast mode (better to just let it look like it's running crazy fast)
6/22/07 - show E-field as a blur above some simulation time setting (only show beam view in "fast" mode)
6/21/07 - why don't XY components of Vector2DNode ever have a negative sign? (because Vector2DNode always displays a magnitude)
6/10/07 - instead of scaling termPrevious and termNext, investigate scaling _springConstant in DNAStrand.evolve (doesn't work right)
6/7/07 - get model for Brownian force (delete "Show Brownian force" feature)
6/5/07 - add close button to ruler (inappropriate, ugly, etc)
6/5/07 - why is fluid.getDragForce not used directly in Bead.move (it appears in the model indirectly)
5/31/07 - make DNA tail draggable (feature not needed)
5/17/07 - improve collision detection in Bead.move (not necessary, only Brownian force causes collisions)
4/24/07 - add AbstractValueControl.setInverted (makes things unnecessarily complex)
3/26/07 - change diameter to radius for bead and laser properties (using diameter makes layout clearer)
3/12/07 - generalize LaserPowerControl (probably not generally useful)

Added custom tick labels for each body mass slider
Added initial support for collisions
Made path node fade out
Reduced number of integration subdivisions from 1000 to 100
Fixed: Moon mass readout intersects earth mass readout in Sun/Earth/Moon mode
Made the space mode express mass in terms of space stations.
Fixed slider mass label to read "planet" instead of Earth
Fixed mass readout to be in Earth masses instead of "planet" masses
Fixed: made the moon magenta when not exactly at moon mass
Fixed: the planet is drawn with an earth image when its mass is equal to earth mass, otherwise drawn as a sphere with a gradient paint
Fixed scales so velocities are visible in all modes and for real/cartoon scale
Added body-specific cartoon scale factors for forces so that all forces are visible in cartoon mode
Fixed: Gravity forces don’t appear until you press start.
Fixed: play/pause controls should be global instead of independently settable per each mode
Changed "Cartoon" to "Cartoon (not to scale)"
Fixed: reset all resets the scale mode
Fixed: sim doesn't pause on reset
Made path lengths depend on the mode, and only go for 1.5 periods of the default orbit
Removed moon slider because it takes up too much space
Improved mode radio buttons: icons change size with relative body size
Improved mode radio buttons: icons are aligned horizontally
Converted mode radio button text to icons
Fixed: Earth System button should set the mass, velocity, and positions for the bodies to the earth system values within the same mode.
Fixed: Drag handlers broken for dragging in cartoon scale
Fixed: Moon position doesn't update when switching to real scale
Fixed: PathNode should be able to toggle between cartoon/real without disappearing
Fixed: label pointer for moon should point the other way in real scale
Fixed: velocity vector arrows do not update properly
Fixed: velocity vector arrows do not respect scale
Fixed icon sizes in the control panel
Fixed: Path node is incorrect in cartoon scale
Improved cartoon mode
Fixed: initial zoom is incorrect
Removed animation and zooming
Added UI for Earth System button
Switched to 4 modes: SP, SPM, PM, Ps
Fixed: Location of "x planet mass" seems inconsistent, sometimes above and sometimes below.
Fixed: Hard to see where "20 planet masses" text overlaps sun body.
# 0.0.05 (46883) Dec 6, 2010
Fixed: "Planet mass" PText is intercepting mouse events.
Fixed: My Planet & Space Station slider icon needs to be bigger
Added a new mode for My Sun, Planet & Earth
Fixed lunar orbit in Sun, Earth & Moon mode
Created space station modes
# 0.0.04 (46625) Nov 29, 2010
Fixed: Sim should start paused, so that the user has to hit play for motion to start
Fixed: Path should only start after user presses "path", not from beginning of simulation
Moved the "Moon" checkbox next to "My Sun & Planet" mode radio button, since that is the only mode in which it can be used
Made mode radio buttons appear in the same place for all canvases
Fixed: Reset all is broken
Made trace disappear after 2 earth years
Removed the phet logo to save vertical space on the control panel
Fixed: In real modes, velocities should not be draggable
Fixed: In real modes, bodies should not be draggable
Fixed: forces not visible in Sun, Earth, Moon mode
Switched to "one canvas per mode" paradigm
Made velocity circles more like "my solar system"
-added a 'v' to the circle
-made the circle gray
-made the vectors go behind planets
-made the 'v' circle go behind vectors
Added arrow icons next to arrow checkboxes
Improved performance of path graphics
Switched to colors in PhetColorScheme
Added a titled border around "show" panel in control panel
Renamed and ordered "show" buttons in control panel
Removed "to scale" button
Initial support for different modes
Fixed: force vectors do not update while the sim is paused
# 0.0.03 (45917) Nov 10, 2010
Added feasibility test for simsharing
# 0.0.02 (45729) Nov 4, 2010
Many improvements for the second version
# 0.0.01 (45696) Nov 3, 2010

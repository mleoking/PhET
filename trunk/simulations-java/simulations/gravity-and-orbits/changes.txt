# 0.0.10 (47428) Dec 27, 2010
12/27/10 dev version with many fixes and changes
only update camera after switching to new mode, to avoid rendering artifacts ("flash" of large body in some cases) 
simplify camera, remove animated zoom stuff
rewind to proper clock time (last time clock was paused) when Rewind button is pressed
rename RestoreProperty to ClockRewindProperty, replace restore with rewind thruout
change control panel button color for ADA compliance, and because blue-on-black is hard to see for everyone
reduce scale of control panel so that everything fits on stage
add "Physics" titled panel around Gravity check box
wire up gravity on/off to model
MessageFormat i18n (value units) for measuring tape
i18n for a couple more strings
add Gravity property and check box, not properly wired up to model
fixed look of disabled rewind button, required ugly copy of FloatingClockControlNode.StepButtonNode.getDisabledImageRescaleOpScale 
remove "Large" and "Very Large" min/max labels on mass sliders, so that we don't have i18n issues, and can use "Space Station" label
improve tick marks on mass sliders so that you can see where the special value (eg "Our Moon") is
reduce font size and unbold the tick mark labels on mass sliders, so that labels don't run together (eg "Large Our Moon")
completed i18n, including use of singular/plural for units
i18n of mass readouts, to handle ordering of value and units
deleted PublicProperty, it's appropriate to move getInitialValue into superclass
Change some class name prefixes from "GO" to "GAO"
Change some class name prefixes from "GravityAndOrbits" to "GAO", where these classes names will be inlined frequently (eg, GAOStrings)
Fixed: replace incomplete "Reset All" node with ResetAllButtonNode
Fixed: Sim doesn't pause on reset all
Fixed: measuring tape checkbox doesn't reset on 'reset all'
Switched back to cartoon image of sun instead of realistic photo

# 0.0.07 (47192) Dec 15, 2010
Fixed: Control panel doesn't fit in the stage

Made the space mode express mass in terms of space stations.
Fixed slider mass label to read "planet" instead of Earth
Fixed mass readout to be in Earth masses instead of "planet" masses
Fixed: made the moon magenta when not exactly at moon mass
Fixed: the planet is drawn with an earth image when its mass is equal to earth mass, otherwise drawn as a sphere with a gradient paint
Fixed scales so velocities are visible in all modes and for real/cartoon scale
Added body-specific cartoon scale factors for forces so that all forces are visible in cartoon mode
Fixed: Gravity forces don’t appear until you press start.
Fixed: play/pause controls should be global instead of independently settable per each mode
Changed "Cartoon" to "Cartoon (not to scale)"
Fixed: reset all resets the scale mode
Fixed: sim doesn't pause on reset
Made path lengths depend on the mode, and only go for 1.5 periods of the default orbit
Removed moon slider because it takes up too much space
Improved mode radio buttons: icons change size with relative body size
Improved mode radio buttons: icons are aligned horizontally
Converted mode radio button text to icons
Fixed: Earth System button should set the mass, velocity, and positions for the bodies to the earth system values within the same mode.
Fixed: Drag handlers broken for dragging in cartoon scale
Fixed: Moon position doesn't update when switching to real scale
Fixed: PathNode should be able to toggle between cartoon/real without disappearing

# 0.0.04 (46625) Nov 29, 2010
Fixed: Sim should start paused, so that the user has to hit play for motion to start
Fixed: Path should only start after user presses "path", not from beginning of simulation
Moved the "Moon" checkbox next to "My Sun & Planet" mode radio button, since that is the only mode in which it can be used
Made mode radio buttons appear in the same place for all canvases
Fixed: Reset all is broken
Made trace disappear after 2 earth years
Removed the phet logo to save vertical space on the control panel
Fixed: In real modes, velocities should not be draggable
Fixed: In real modes, bodies should not be draggable

High Priority:

Graphs
    Weight in lbs readout on graph does not equal weight in pounds readout on gray slider
    Graphs need correct vertical and horizontal units, and ability to change weight units between metric and english
    Need a reset graph only button
    Difference between green cal and red cal lines unclear.  Is one cal in and one cal out?
Is this a known bug: 'restart' button should clear graph
    - click 'reset all', wait a couple seconds, then click 'restart': graph
      lines are still there, but are drawn over
To emphasize the meaning of the bar charts, you might have big labels on
    the left and right of the center line of the bar chart: 'Diet' on the
    left and 'Exercise' on the right (perhaps with the 'edit' buttons below
    the labels)
Add foods/exercise
    -Marj is helping with this
    -The energy cost of walking/running is about 1.43 kcal/kg/mile, swimming 4x higher, biking 1/4 value of walking
    -Suggested food bag:  Hamburger, large fries, large soda (not supersize),
        submarine sandwich, candy bar, icecream (as you have), a piece of fruit -
        apple, banana or orange, a serving of vegetables, slice of pizza, ?
Satisfy learning goal: How long do you have to bike/walk to burn a certain number of calories?
    the learning goal seems too easy: to figure out "How long do you have to
    bike/walk to burn a certain number of calories?", you just have to look
    at the number of kcal/day in the text of the exercise type.
        might be better to ask how long it would take to lose 10 lbs?
Number of calories of healthy diet should be editable
Fix Time scale (perhaps slow down)
Performance: consider profiling or changing clock rate
Is it true that I can eat a hamburger per day above a 'healthy diet', and
  have a steady weight (though a ~10 lb gain) after about three years?
    - to see this, click 'reset all', wait until you're 23 years old, then
      add a hamburger per day.

Med Priority:
+Add a legend for caloric breakdown pie chart

Low Priority:
+Editors for exercise (change time or intensity)
+Put BMI somewhere other than scale
+Caloric intake changes resting metabolic rate
    Extra carbs or protein can increase RMR (not agreed upon)
+Change in intake or expenditure … doesn’t lead to ideal weight loss, since other compartments adjust to compensate
+Better values/more options for base diets
+KG gained per day should be a function of caloric distribution over lipids, carbs and protein

Discussion:
3000 kcal/day wrong, should be 2000kcal/day
    should this be exact?
    can't force 2000kcal/day and prescribed ffm and have balanced calories
-cauliflower fat content double check
    confirmed this at: http://www.calorie-count.com/calories/item/11761.html
Should fat/fat free composition change based on diet & exercise?
    Check with bill
    -emailed bill
Should we allow option to show BMI in English units?
    -it looks like the universal unit for this is metric kg/m^2

6. I would also be happy to provide calorie numbers for selected physical activities
just let me know what you might have in mind.

Energy expenditure:
Metabolic Rate – sleeping only (lowest)
Basal or Resting metabolic rate – from sitting around but awake
Planned exercise/work –
Non-exercise activity thermal-genesis – (fidgeting) this changes when you do exercise

Possibly visualize balance of caloric intake as scale
Should it be a daily view only or extended view?

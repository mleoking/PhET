Constrain slider range
Graphs need correct vertical and horizontal units, and ability to change weight units between metric and english
Add foods/exercise
    -Marj will help
    -The energy cost of walking/running is about 1.43 kcal/kg/mile, swimming 4x higher, biking 1/4 value of walking
    -Suggested food bag:  Hamburger, large fries, large soda (not supersize),
        submarine sandwich, candy bar, icecream (as you have), a piece of fruit -
        apple, banana or orange, a serving of vegetables, slice of pizza, ?
Satisfy learning goal: How long do you have to bike/walk to burn a certain number of calories?
Remove zoom handler
Remove draggable triangles on bar chart
number of calories of healthy diet should be editable
3000 kcal/day wrong, should be 2000kcal/day
    should this be exact?
    can't force 2000kcal/day and prescribed ffm and have balanced calories
Add graphical icons to bar chart elements
    Check FDA & related sites for food composition icons
Should fat/fat free composition change based on diet & exercise?
    Check with bill
    -emailed bill
Should we allow option to show BMI in English units?
    -it looks like the universal unit for this is metric kg/m^2

Med Priority:
+Add a legend for caloric breakdown pie chart

Low Priority:
+Editors for exercise (change time or intensity)
+Put BMI somewhere other than scale
+Caloric intake changes resting metabolic rate
    Extra carbs or protein can increase RMR (not agreed upon)
+Change in intake or expenditure … doesn’t lead to ideal weight loss, since other compartments adjust to compensate
+Better values/more options for base diets
+Better behavior for heart/health indicator
+KG gained per day should be a function of caloric distribution over lipids, carbs and protein

6. I would also be happy to provide calorie numbers for selected physical activities
just let me know what you might have in mind.

Energy expenditure:
Metabolic Rate – sleeping only (lowest)
Basal or Resting metabolic rate – from sitting around but awake
Planned exercise/work –
Non-exercise activity thermal-genesis – (fidgeting) this changes when you do exercise

Possibly visualize balance of caloric intake as scale
Should it be a daily view only or extended view?
	- extended

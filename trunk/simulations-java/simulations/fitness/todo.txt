6. I would also be happy to provide calorie numbers for selected physical activities
just let me know what you might have in mind. The energy cost of walking is about 1.43 kcal/kg/mile.
I would note that the cost per mile for running is the same.
The energy cost of swimming per mile is about 4 times higher than walking/running while the energy cost of
biking per mile is about 1/4 that of walking/running.

Energy expenditure:
Metabolic Rate – sleeping only (lowest)
Basal or Resting metabolic rate – from sitting around but awake
Planned exercise/work –
Non-exercise activity thermal-genesis – (fidgeting) this changes when you do exercise

Energy intake:
Calorie intake effects RMR…
Extra carbohydrates or protein intake – can effect (increase) RMR according to number of calories you took in (not agreed upon).

Change in intake or expenditure … doesn’t lead to ideal weight loss.

Possibly visualize balance of caloric intake as scale
Should it be a daily view only or extended view?
	- expend

Start with a basic daily food diet … # of calories per day, then they can add a piece of cake or subtract a Gatorade.
Learning Goal: How long do you have to bike/walk to burn a certain number of calories?

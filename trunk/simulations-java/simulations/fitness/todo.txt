+Should fat/fat free composition change based on diet & exercise?
+Better values/more options for base diets
+Change units
+Constrain slider range
+Graphs
+Better behavior for heart/health indicator
+KG gained per day should be a function of caloric distribution over lipids, carbs and protein
+Add a legend for caloric breakdown pie chart
+Add foods/exercise
+The energy cost of walking/running is about 1.43 kcal/kg/mile, swimming 4x higher, biking 1/4 value of walking
+Suggested food bag:  Hamburger, large fries, large soda (not supersize),
    submarine sandwich, candy bar, icecream (as you have), a piece of fruit -
    apple, banana or orange, a serving of vegetables, slice of pizza, ?
+Satisfy learning goal: How long do you have to bike/walk to burn a certain number of calories?

Low Priority:
+Editors for exercise (change time or intensity)
+Put BMI somewhere other than scale
+Caloric intake changes resting metabolic rate
    Extra carbs or protein can increase RMR (not agreed upon)
+Change in intake or expenditure … doesn’t lead to ideal weight loss, since other compartments adjust to compensate

6. I would also be happy to provide calorie numbers for selected physical activities
just let me know what you might have in mind.

Energy expenditure:
Metabolic Rate – sleeping only (lowest)
Basal or Resting metabolic rate – from sitting around but awake
Planned exercise/work –
Non-exercise activity thermal-genesis – (fidgeting) this changes when you do exercise

Possibly visualize balance of caloric intake as scale
Should it be a daily view only or extended view?

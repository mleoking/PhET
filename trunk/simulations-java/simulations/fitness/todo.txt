+Should specify times for each food and exercise (including per day)
+Put BMI somewhere other than scale
+Suggested food bag:  Hamburger, large fries, large soda (not supersize),
    submarine sandwich, candy bar, icecream (as you have), a piece of fruit -
    apple, banana or orange, a serving of vegetables, slice of pizza, ?

1. I think it would be best to use a two compartment model to classify body composition.
The two compartments would be fat free mass and fat mass. Fat free mass would include muscle mass, bone mass, major organs.
Fat mass would include storage fat and essential fat. I would use these identifiers for the sliders which can now total to 100%.
For women I would only allow the % of fat mass to vary between 10 and 40 % and for men between 4 and 40%.

2. Normal values for the reference man (22yr; 5ft 8.5in) would be an overall body mass of 70.0 kg
with a fat free mass of 60.0 kg (about 86%) and a fat mass of 10.0 kg (about 14%).

3. Normal values for the reference woman (22yr; 5ft 4.5in) would be an overall body mass of 57.0 kg
with a fat free mass of 42.0 kg (about 74%) and a fat mass of 15.0 kg (about 26%).

4. Basal metabolic rate would be calculated based upon fat free mass (FFM) using the formula BMR = 392 + 21.8(FFM).
The units would be kcal per day. This formula would apply to men or women and is valid between about 20 and 50 years of age.

5. For daily energy expenditure, you could multiply BMR by the factor that best describes
physical activity level - 1.3 for very sedentary, 1.4 for sedentary, 1.5 for moderate activity, 1.6 for very active, and 1.7 for competitive athlete.

6. I would also be happy to provide calorie numbers for selected physical activities
just let me know what you might have in mind. The energy cost of walking is about 1.43 kcal/kg/mile.
I would note that the cost per mile for running is the same.
The energy cost of swimming per mile is about 4 times higher than walking/running while the energy cost of
biking per mile is about 1/4 that of walking/running.

1. I like the use of the bar graphs to express calories per day. My version is difficult to control but maybe features are not operational.
For me, varying the intake bar results in a change in the expenditure bar and vice versa.

2. I would not use the Benedict equation for BMR.
I would use the equation that I provided for fat free mass plus I would go ahead and develop two slders based upon fat free mass and fat mass.

3. I also wonder how the graphs will be incorporated into the process.

Energy expenditure:
Metabolic Rate – sleeping only (lowest)
Basal or Resting metabolic rate – from sitting around but awake
Planned exercise/work –
Non-exercise activity thermal-genesis – (fidgeting) this changes when you do exercise

Energy intake:
Calorie intake effects RMR…
Extra carbohydrates or protein intake – can effect (increase) RMR according to number of calories you took in (not agreed upon).

Change in intake or expenditure … doesn’t lead to ideal weight loss.

L.G. – How long do you have to bike/walk to burn a certain number of calories?


Possibly visualize balance of caloric intake as scale
Should it be a daily view only or extended view?
	- expend

Start with a basic daily food diet … # of calories per day, then they can add a piece of cake or subtract a Gatorade.

Change exercise or food

Muscle and Fat? … Not total 100%.
Muscle mass doesn’t change much …
Lean mass … 40%
Fat mass …
Other mass (bones, …
Ideal male and ideal female

Male 40% muscle, 20% fat, 40% other …

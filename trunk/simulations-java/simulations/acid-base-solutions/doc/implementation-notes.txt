Implementation notes for "Acid-Base Solutions" (acid-base-solutions)

This simulation began its life as a simplification of advanced-acid-base-solutions.
Much of the model and some of the view were borrowed from that sim, and adapted/simplified
as needed.

There is no model-view transform between the model and view portions of this sim. 
The transform is implicitly 1:1, with identical coordinate frames.
One unit of distance in the model is one unit of distance in the play area.
Positive x is to the right, positive y is down.

Location and visibility of objects is handled in the model.
Model elements notify view elements when location or visibility changes.
View elements handle setting their own offsets and visibility by consulting their associated model elements.

The origin of view elements is generally described in each element's javadoc.
The beaker's origin is at its bottom center, and this point is the basis for specifying
all other object locations in ABSConstants.

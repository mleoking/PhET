==================================================================================

4/27/09 implement Molecule Counts using Swing layout node, wire up to checkbox
4/15/09 add placeholder for Concentrations Graph, wire up to checkbox
4/15/09 add empty dialogs for Equilibrium Expressions, Reaction Equations, wire up to checkboxes
4/15/09 add Symbol Legend dialog, wire up to checkbox
4/15/09 add misc View controls, not wired up
4/15/09 add beaker controls View, not wired up
4/15/09 create molecule images for general reactions
4/14/09 revise model, still has many unresolved design issues related to strength

1/23/09 encapsulate all symbols in ABSSymbols
1/23/09 localize all acid and base names
1/23/09 add molecule counts and pH to model
1/23/09 model for base solutions
1/23/09 model for pure water, acids, bases, acid solutions
1/20/09 start fleshing out user interface of first module
1/19/09 framework for all modules and persistence
1/12/09 set up basic framework, based on sim-template
1/12/09 changes log file created

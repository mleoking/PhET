 acid-base-solutions : development history
==================================================================================

TODO:
- AbstractMoleculeCounts.ValueNode puts a rectangle around union of value+negligible
- rewrite model
- PSwing repaint problem with BeakerControlsNode?
- connect equilibrium expressions to model
- connect reaction equations to model
- H2O should not be scalable in Reaction Equations, should change to Color.BLACK when scaling is enabled
- revisit implementation of Reaction Equations and Equilibrium Expressions
- particle views
- scale image files

DEFER:
- add ability to restrict Strength slider to one section of the range (only needed if we add "Custom Weak" acid/base)
- smooth, curved lip on beaker (eye candy)

ISSUES:
- precision of concentration text field
- vertical spacing of items in solute combo box
- alignment of icons and labels in concentration graph
- resolve i18n layout issues with Reset All button and View controls
- better pattern for model, less use of instanceof

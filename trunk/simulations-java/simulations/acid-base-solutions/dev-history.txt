 acid-base-solutions : development history
==================================================================================

TODO:
- revisit implementation of Reaction Equations and Equilibrium Expressions
- H2O should not be scalable in Reaction Equations, should change to Color.BLACK when scaling is enabled
- solution control panel
- particle views
- model
- connect model and view
- "Negligible" in Concentrations graph
- additional developer controls?
- scale image files
- Reset All
- rewrite SolutionsCanvas.updateLayout
- add ability to restrict Strength slider to one section of the range

DONE:
5/11/09 localization
5/11/09 create static instances of all specific acids and bases
5/11/09 lighten pH probe shaft so that molecule count symbols are visible when they overlap the probe
5/11/09 rewrite model, including fictitious "intermediate" acids and bases
5/11/09 start using Java 5
5/7/09 strength slider
5/7/09 concentration controls
5/5/09 remove outlined text from equations, not required, performance/memory issues
5/4/09 Equilibrium Expressions dialog + dev controls
5/4/09 more dev controls for Reaction Equations
4/29/09 Reaction Equations for acids, bases, water
4/29/09 add icons to Symbol Legend dialog
4/29/09 standardize text style for A, B, M
4/29/09 check in Lewis Structure images
4/28/09 first pass at Concentration graph, adapted many pieces from ph-scale
4/27/09 add beaker label, wire up to checkbox
4/27/09 implement Molecule Counts using Swing layout node, wire up to checkbox
4/15/09 add placeholder for Concentrations Graph, wire up to checkbox

1/23/09 encapsulate all symbols in ABSSymbols
1/23/09 localize all acid and base names
1/23/09 add molecule counts and pH to model
1/23/09 model for base solutions
1/23/09 model for pure water, acids, bases, acid solutions
1/20/09 start fleshing out user interface of first module
1/19/09 framework for all modules and persistence
1/12/09 set up basic framework, based on sim-template
1/12/09 changes log file created

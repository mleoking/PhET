 acid-base-solutions : development history
==================================================================================

TODO:
- fix layout of concentration graph
- Reset All
- connect model and view
- H2O should not be scalable in Reaction Equations, should change to Color.BLACK when scaling is enabled
- revisit implementation of Reaction Equations and Equilibrium Expressions
- particle views
- "Negligible" in Concentrations graph 
- scale image files
- rewrite SolutionsCanvas.updateLayout
- add ability to restrict Strength slider to one section of the range
- support arrow keys in concentration text field
- smooth, curved lip on beaker
- redo layout of molecule counts, Swing layout strategy isn't working well

TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- pH color scheme
- conductivity tester (CAB feedback required)
- add MVT to handle relationship between model element locations and PNode locations
- handle model-view transforms in PHMeterNode
- fix resize behavior of main frame, nodes below the beaker are not visible if main frame is resized wider 
- center everything in the play area

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- not obvious what "Show H2O Molecules" check box pertains to
- label x-axis of concentration graph? SR didn't see correlation to reaction equation
- Save/Load?
- baseline alignment of reaction equations (how did I do this in advanced-acid-base-solutions?)

LOW PRIORITY
- control panel layout issues, left justification
- use SolutionFactory in TestSolutionControl
- ditch ABSRadioButton in TestSolutionControl, separate listener for each radio button
- chem symbol api, handle baseline/bold/italic/super/sub/color, use Piccolo for layout control
- how are reaction equations being vertically aligned in advanced-acid-base-solutions? they look better
- icons for tool controls 
- better images for molecules
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

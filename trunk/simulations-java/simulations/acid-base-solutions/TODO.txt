TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES
- 5/15/10, design completed
- 6/1/10-7/2/10, interviews for BCCE
- 8/1/10, sim showable for BCCE

HIGH PRIORITY
- wire up controls that select solution
- add locations to model (no need for MVT, only needed for tool interactions with solution & beaker)
- drag behavior for pH meter
- magnifying glass from prototype
- bar graph, adapt from advanced-acid-base-solutions
- conductivity tester

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- resolve design issues with exclusivity of tools

LOW PRIORITY
- icons for tools
- better images for molecules
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- ABSRadioButton

TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- if concentration graph has only 3 bars, center them in the chart
- try to make symbols in reaction equations line up with bars in concentration graph

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- change the name of the "Test Solution" tab to "Introduction"?
- which "Tools" selections disable when "Views" controls?
- change "Magnifying Glass" to "Molecules"?
- change "Show H2O Molecules" to "Show Water"?
- change "Concentration Graph" to "Concentration"?
- confusion between pH paper and bars in graph by allowing them to be shown at the same time?

LOW PRIORITY
- scale light bulb image files, remove setScale calls in ConductivityTesterNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

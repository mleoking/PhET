TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES
- 5/15/10, design completed
- 6/1/10-7/2/10, interviews for BCCE
- 8/1/10, sim showable for BCCE

HIGH PRIORITY
- prototype: add bar graphs ala advanced-acid-base-solutions
- prototype: add weak and strong base models (use models from advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- range of "weak" Ka or Kb: 1e-7 to 1e2
- range of "strong" Ka or Kb: 1e2 to 1e3

MEDUIUM PRIORITY

LOW PRIORITY

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- ABSRadioButton

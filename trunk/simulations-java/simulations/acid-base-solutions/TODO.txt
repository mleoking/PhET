TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- if concentration graph has only 3 bars, center them in the chart
- try to make symbols in reaction equations line up with bars in concentration graph
- fix resize behavior of main frame, nodes below the beaker are not visible if main frame is resized wider 
- bottom-center everything in the play area

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- change the name of the "Test Solution" tab to ...??
- add a "none" radio button to "Tests" control panel
- disable all "View" controls when ...??
- change "Magnifying Glass" to "Molecules"
- change "Show H2O Molecules" to "Show Water"
- change "Concentration Graph" to "Concentration"
- change "neither" to "Liquid"
- add MVT to handle relationship between model element locations and PNode locations

LOW PRIORITY
- scale light bulb image files, remove setScale calls in ConductivityTesterNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

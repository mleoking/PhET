TODO list for acid-base-solutions

HIGH PRIORITY
- prototype: implement H2O molecule view with 3 layers of images
- prototype: what is the range of Ka?
- prototype: algorithm for number of molecules displayed doesn't give desired behavior
- prototype: counts don't add up to MoleculesNode.maxMolecules
- prototype: add bar graphs ala advanced-acid-base-solutions?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY

TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- Q: What is the desired mapping of pH to color? The entire visible spectrum looks a little too dark at each end.
- Q: When the solution is changed, is it appropriate to immediately remove the color from any part of the paper that's not in solution? (It currently does.)
- Q: When the solution is changed, is it appropriate to gradually animate the color of the portion of the paper that's in solution? (It currently does.)
- Q: When the paper is dipped in the solution, should we animate the color of the paper? (It currently does not. Need to know pH of undipped paper.)
- Q: When the dipped paper is in solution, its color is affected by the solution color. (leave as is, make solution colorless, or move paper in front of solution)
- conductivity tester
- add MVT to handle relationship between model element locations and PNode locations
- fix resize behavior of main frame, nodes below the beaker are not visible if main frame is resized wider 
- bottom-center everything in the play area

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- not obvious what "Show H2O Molecules" check box pertains to
- label x-axis of concentration graph? SR didn't see correlation to reaction equation
- Save/Load?
- baseline alignment of reaction equations (how did I do this in advanced-acid-base-solutions?)

LOW PRIORITY
- if pH paper color animation is not desired, delete associated code in PHPaper
- control panel layout issues, left justification
- use SolutionFactory in TestSolutionControl
- chem symbol api, handle baseline/bold/italic/super/sub/color, use Piccolo for layout control
- icons for tool controls 
- better images for molecules
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- what should conductivity tester do for Solution=Water?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- should control panels icons be vertically aligned, or positioned close to their associated labels?
- change the name of the "Test Solution" tab to "Introduction"?
- which "Tools" selections disable when "Views" controls?
- change "Magnifying Glass" to "Molecules"?
- change "Show H2O Molecules" to "Show Water"?
- change "Concentration Graph" to "Concentration"?
- confusion between pH paper and bars in graph by allowing them to be shown at the same time?
- should "Views" be about "Tests" in control panel? which do we want students to play with first?

LOW PRIORITY
- scale light bulb image files, remove setScale calls in ConductivityTesterNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

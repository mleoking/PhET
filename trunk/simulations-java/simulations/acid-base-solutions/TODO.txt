TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- redo battery image file, it's being scaled up
- use molecule color for "negligible" in Concentration Graph
- try to make symbols in reaction equations line up with bars in concentration graph
- light rays in conductivity tester
- handle probe locations better in conductivity tester
- rethink origin of conductivity tester node
- fix resize behavior of main frame, nodes below the beaker are not visible if main frame is resized wider 
- bottom-center everything in the play area
- change the name of the "Test Solution" tab
- add a "none" radio button to "Tests" control panel
- disable all "View" controls when "pH Paper" or "Conductivity" is selected OR never disable any "View" controls
- change "Magnifying Glass" to "Molecules"
- change "Show H2O Molecules" to "Show Water"
- change "Concentration Graph" to "Concentration"
- change "neither" to "Liquid"

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- improved layout of icons next to radio buttons
- add MVT to handle relationship between model element locations and PNode locations

LOW PRIORITY
- left justify controls in control panels?
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt
- scale light bulb image files, remove setScale calls in ConductivityTesterNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

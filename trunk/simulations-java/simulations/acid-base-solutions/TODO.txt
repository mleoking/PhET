TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES
- 5/15/10, design completed
- 6/1/10-7/2/10, interviews for BCCE
- 8/1/10, sim showable for BCCE

HIGH PRIORITY
- pH meter checkbox instead of radio button
- fix drag behavior for pH meter, constrain, errors in coordinate frame transforms
- bar graph, adapt from advanced-acid-base-solutions
- conductivity tester
- pH paper
- reaction equations below beaker

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- resolve design issues with exclusivity of tools

LOW PRIORITY
- icons for tools
- better images for molecules
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- ABSRadioButton

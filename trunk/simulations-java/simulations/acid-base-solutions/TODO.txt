TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- conductivity tester
- add MVT to handle relationship between model element locations and PNode locations
- fix resize behavior of main frame, nodes below the beaker are not visible if main frame is resized wider 
- bottom-center everything in the play area

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- not obvious what "Show H2O Molecules" check box pertains to
- label x-axis of concentration graph? SR didn't see correlation to reaction equation
- Save/Load?

LOW PRIORITY
- control panel layout issues, left justification
- use SolutionFactory in TestSolutionControl
- icons for tool controls 
- better images for molecules (no bite out of A-)
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

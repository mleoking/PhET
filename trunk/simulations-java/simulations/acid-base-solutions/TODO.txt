TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES

HIGH PRIORITY
- use molecule color for "negligible" in Concentration Graph
- gray out View controls when "Conductivity Tester" tool is selected
- put "Show H2O Molecules" check box under "Magnifying Glass" radio button, slightly indented
- add symbols and icons after Solution choice names in "Test Solution" tab
- center whitespace of chart in beaker
- try to make symbols in reaction equations line up with bars in concentration graph
- light rays in conductivity tester
- handle probe locations better in conductivity tester
- rethink origin of conductivity tester node
- icons for tool controls 
- allow pH paper to be dragged horizontally, so it can be held up to color key (issues with dragging through side of beaker)
- add MVT to handle relationship between model element locations and PNode locations
- fix resize behavior of main frame, nodes below the beaker are not visible if main frame is resized wider 
- bottom-center everything in the play area

MEDUIUM PRIORITY

LOW PRIORITY
- left justify controls in control panels?
- use SolutionFactory in TestSolutionControl
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt
- scale light bulb image files, remove setScale call in ConductivityTesterNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- HTMLCheckBox (usable in advanced-acid-base-solutions RatioCheckBox? see #1704)

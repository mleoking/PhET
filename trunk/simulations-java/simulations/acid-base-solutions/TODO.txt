TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES
- 5/15/10, design completed
- 6/1/10-7/2/10, interviews for BCCE
- 8/1/10, sim showable for BCCE

HIGH PRIORITY
- fix drag behavior for pH meter, constrain, errors in coordinate frame transforms
- fix resize behavior of main frame, nodes below the beaker are not visible if main frame is resized wider 
- center everything in the play area
- don't show other tools in magnifying glass
- control panel layout issues

MEDUIUM PRIORITY
- not obvious what "Show H2O Molecules" check box pertains to
- Save/Load?
- if a tool is dragged so that it's fully inside magnifying glass, releasing it makes it inaccessible
- baseline alignment of reaction equations (impossible?)
- conductivity tester (CAB feedback required)
- pH paper (CAB feedback required)

LOW PRIORITY
- icons for tool controls
- better images for molecules
- export design doc from Google, check into SVN
- model.txt

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PrecisionDecimal (also appears in ph-scale, advanced-acid-base-solutions)
- ABSRadioButton
- HTMLCheckBox

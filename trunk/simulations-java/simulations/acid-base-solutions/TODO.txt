TODO list for acid-base-solutions

MILESTONES
- 5/15/10, design completed
- 8/1/10, sim "showable"

HIGH PRIORITY
- prototype: revert to single-layer H2O representation used in 0.00.05
- prototype: what is the range of Ka?
- prototype: algorithm for number of molecules displayed doesn't give desired behavior
- prototype: counts don't add up to MoleculesNode.maxMolecules
- prototype: add bar graphs ala advanced-acid-base-solutions?

MEDUIUM PRIORITY

LOW PRIORITY

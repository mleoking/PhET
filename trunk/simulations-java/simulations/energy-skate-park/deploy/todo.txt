Questions:
• Is simulation supposed to pause when end of recording time is reached?
   -if not, are E vs. T readouts supposed to continue to update?
• Is performance good enough during track friction > 0 case?  I removed duplicated computation in radius of curvature approximation.
	Removing this duplicated work resulted in substantial improvement (non-friction case = 10% processor, old friction case=30% processor, new fixed case=18% processor), but a difference in visible performance is still visible under a profiler.  Should I continue to investigate this issue?
	One performance optimization we can do for this simulation would be to cache values for points on the spline after user has stopped manipulating it (tradeoff processor usage for memory usage).  However, this would be nontrivial work, and I'm not sure it would pay off.  I would do a feasibility test to make sure enough track data can be cached at high enough resolution to make this effective.

To Do:
• Add Spanish translation.
• Fix listener leaks
• Better mountain graphics?
• Add an ellipsis for menu items or buttons that pop up a dialog
• "Bar Graph" button and "Bar Chart" window have different text.
• Bug: On the tracks that open in roller coaster mode, when you right click, you cannot change the mode
• When I open the Energy vs Position graph, the performance rapidly decreases.
    -On my machine, it is approx 25% processor usage without this E vs X graph, 40% with.
• "Bring back the skater" button broken sometimes (mac problem?)
• "Bring back the skater" button should have setopaque false for mac
• Zoom out button on mac chopped off right 1/4 due to resize handles on window.
• Implement separate layers for time series graph (currently different series are interleaved).  How long would this take?
    To implement this without substantial loss of performance, path segments should be drawn that are longer than 1/2 the stroke width.
    This means instead of painting just the most recent data point, the last N data points should be drawn, where N is a function of the stroke width.
    Also, to maintain high performance, the last N data points should be drawn using optimized code (not the same code that draws single points).
    There will be slight (a few percent) performance degradation for this layered representation.
    I expect it will take around 2 hours to implement and test this.
• Generalize ClockControlPanel for reuse

To Interview On:
• PE=0 line is visible in space
• Pie chart disappears when going underneath PE=0

Maybe:
• Support for undo?
• Skater location is not correctly saved in File->Save (if on track)
• Track can become dissociated from mouse during drag after proposed match.
• Save skater character as part of a saved state? (30 min or so)
• Performance problems after lots of runs?
• Allow user to save a "batch" of experiments, and switch between them.
• gradient for earth in energyskate park sim (see projectile motion)
    -Simple solution would degrade performance, more complicated solution would take up to an hour
• Improve performance e.g. during right-click interaction with track
• Energy conservation (wait until we see visible problem)
• Skater should point at track while dragging: Unpredictable behavior when there are 2+ possible matches.
• Bounciness & Stickiness to give realistic behavior for little perpendicular bounces?
• Mystery planet where they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
        With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
        Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...
• Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint, the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.
• Crashing skater?
• Add game-ish modes
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?
• Another thing I was wondering was if the dots had a fixed time spacing, and if so what was it.
• Would it take much time to have a right click on the character bring up the character choices?

Postponed:
• Add rotation for skater in the air.
• Add visualization for force diagram (or just normal force?)
• With high enough speed, sometimes the skater can pass through a track (or ground)
• Mouse and spline control point can become separated from each other.
• Performance problem when all charts open with complicated track.
    -I have trouble reproducing this problem (perhaps you could email me a track that exhibits this problem?)  Also not sure how much time should be spent solving the situation with 3 charts and a complicated track.
• Part of grid is disappearing when pie chart disappears (low priority)

Double check:
Floor in outer space
max number of history points
After going to space, then dragging the gravity slider to some nonzero value, the floor is invisible.
zero-point potential y-values getting recorded
Moving the energy zero point while paused doesn't update pie chart.
Changing "roller coaster mode" doesn't update graphics

Added a test that shows jade fails for the energyskatepark type problem, see travoltage project

Ideas for energy conservation in the dynamics of this simulation.
    1. Try saving total energy, not frame to frame.  FreeSplineMode is not single instance, can't store there.
    2. If any 1 step destroys the total energy too much, roll it back.
    3. Redistribute the energy after each step
    4. Different number of segments in the cubic spline
    5. Smaller time steps

Added a test that shows jade fails for the energyskatepark type problem, see travoltage project

Ideas for energy conservation in the dynamics of this simulation.
    1. Try saving total energy, not frame to frame.  FreeSplineMode is not single instance, can't store there.
    2. If any 1 step destroys the total energy too much, roll it back.
    3. Redistribute the energy after each step
    4. Different number of segments in the cubic spline
    5. Smaller time steps
    

• Energy conservation is handling about 6/8 (?) cases correctly, there are still a few instances in which it could fail.
criteria are (with, without friction)x(too much proposed energy, too little proposed energy)x(gravity on, off).
Depending on the effectiveness of patches, other patches are tested. Also during track attachment and release.

ParametricFunction2D:
line 32 could do flat search for line-based
line 80 could do for finite segment

-Should there be separate controls for playback mode?
    For example, should the user be able to set the "live" speed and "playback" speed independently?
    Currently the "time speed" indicators on record, live and playback panels all refer to the same master clock.
-Should there be a "record" button on the time series graph?
    Otherwise, the user will have to use the "play" button on the main panel, which may be confusing.
-Now the semantics are something like:
1. When simulation is running without E vs. T graph, mode is "live"
2. When user brings up E vs. T graph, mode switches to "record"
3. When user presses playback on E vs. T graph, mode switches to "playback"
How does user switch mode from "playback" to "record" or "live" again?  Perhaps there should be a "record" button on the E vs. T controls.

Charts are correctly overlaid in Rotation, but not in Energy Skate Park.
-I don't think this is true; full repaint is in layered mode, but not incremental repaint

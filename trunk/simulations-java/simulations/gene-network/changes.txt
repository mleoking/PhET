>5/24/10 Fixed an issue where the lactose injector was not well positioned on Macs due to font size differences.
# 1.01.03 (40996) May 21, 2010
5/21/10 Fix (I think) for issue where a little blue circle appears in the play area at startup on Macs.
# 1.01.02 (40994) May 21, 2010
5/21/10 Set color of background panel for controller on lactose injector, needed on Mac platform.
# 1.01.01 (40992) May 21, 2010
5/21/10 > Fixed an issue where injector was not sized properly on Mac.
# 1.01.00 (40511) May 7, 2010
5/7/10 Redeploying due to error in name of screenshot file.
# 1.00.00 (40507) May 7, 2010
5/7/10 > Initial publication of this simulation.
5/7/10 Added ability for LacY to be produced even if LacZ gene isn't present (2nd tab only).
# 0.00.19 (40403) May 5, 2010
5/5/10 Version with several modifications based on feedback from GS and JT of UBC.
5/4/10 Made LacI hold on to lactose longer.
5/4/10 Fixed issue where motion was being adjusted based on number of steps and not amount of time that had passed.
5/4/10 LacI binds more quickly to Lac Operator.
5/3/10 Changed to produce less LacI.
5/3/10 Changed to make fewer LacYs than LacZs per strand of mRNA.  This was requested by UBC team.
5/3/10 Fixed issue where the presence of LacI was affecting LacZ-LacY production even if the lac operator wasn't present.
# 0.00.18 (40008) Apr 21, 2010
4/21/10 2nd candidate for review with UBC folks, fixes issue with placement of LacY on the cell membrane.
# 0.00.17 (40005) Apr 21, 2010
4/21/10 Candidate for review with UBC folks, includes adjustments to params that should keep lactose levels more stable.
# 0.00.16 (39752) Apr 8, 2010
4/8/10 Fixed a bug with the lactose meter on the 2nd tab, adjusted some params to make lacose get into cells quicker, made 1st tab achieve homeostasis.
# 0.00.15 (39672) Apr 6, 2010
4/6/10 Version with 2nd tab pretty much fully implemented, publishing for review & feedback.

3/10/10 Fixed an issue with reset and the lactose meter.
# 0.00.12 (39197) Mar 10, 2010
3/10/10 Added lactose meter
# 0.00.11 (39158) Mar 5, 2010
3/5/10 Changes based on feedback from 1st round of interviews, plus lactose meter.
# 0.0.10 (38880) Feb 23, 2010
2/23/10 Retrying a deploy to dev that failed the first time.
# 0.0.09 (38877) Feb 23, 2010
2/23/10 Implemented some changes to avoid race conditions between RNA polymerase and lacI.
# 0.0.08 (38207) Jan 22, 2010
1/22/10 Several changes based on initial testing, see other entries for details.
Made click on moving objects stop their motion rather than requiring drag.
Made click on things in tool box add them, rather than requiring drag.
Made Reset button into Reset All to match PhET conventions.
Fixed issue where button on injector would work when invisible.
Fixed issue where dotted lines would disappear from DNA strand on reset.

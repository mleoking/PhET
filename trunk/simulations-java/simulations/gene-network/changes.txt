5/7/10 Added ability for LacY to be produced even if LacZ gene isn't present (2nd tab only).
# 0.00.19 (40403) May 5, 2010
5/5/10 Version with several modifications based on feedback from GS and JT of UBC.
5/4/10 Made LacI hold on to lactose longer.
5/4/10 Fixed issue where motion was being adjusted based on number of steps and not amount of time that had passed.

Fixed: "Reset All" does not remove the small play/pause button to the left of graph.
Removed the units label from the right hand side of the chart
Removed the arrow above the time axis
Fixed: If you start the sim and immediately open the FBD, then use FBD to apply a force the sim stays paused. The sim should unpause when you do this, just like if you were dragging the object.
# 1.03.81 (44908) Oct 8, 2010
Fixed: Applied force text field is broken on graph tabs
# 1.03.80 (44767) Oct 6, 2010

Fixed: When sim is paused, dragging the "object position" slider causes incorrect normal force to point straight up.
Fixed: In "Friction Tab", remove the Force Vectors radio buttons and replace with just checkbox for vectors as in 1st tab.
Fixed: "Force Vectors" checkbox is buggy--the vectors only appear to listen to the box state when the object moves.
Moved the ramp angle readout to the right so that it is not directly under "meters" text, and beyond the Applied Force text box so that these don't get confused.

New in 0.22
.	Make applied force orange, make wall force the drab yellow.
.	Delete the ramp-change-color feature.
.	rename velocity to m/s (not meters/second).
.	Redraw track for slider to look more slider-like.
.	Scale down the mouse-applied force.
.	Shrink the control panel width (if possible).
.	Changing objects on the 1st panel also changes coeff. of friction.
		We mention the coeff in the object name as multi-line.
.	Earth should be lighter green (to make the dark fonts on it more visible).
.	�Playback� is better than �play� on the playback panel.
.	delete record button.  (Go/Pause is better than record)
.	Crate should have a higher coeff than the file cabinet.
.	Use �friction coefficient� not �friction� where applicable.
.	Bugfix: overheated button shows up in wrong spot (low resolution).
.	Add subscripts: F<sub>gravity, F<sub>friction, W<sub>applied, not for Energies, though.
.	Test 2 columns for in-plot readouts.
		Looks good.
.	Abbreviate the in-plot readouts (delete "parallel", delete units repetition, etc.)
.	Line up control buttons to the left of the graphs.
.	Bugfix: Dragging the playback cursor doesn't change values.
.	Bugfix: Dragging the block with friction off adds heat.
.	Bugfix: Clear heat doesn't work while pause is on.
		>> I think this was only clearing the heat for the ramp/block colors, now this feature has been removed.
.	When you make a change while it is paused, the change should be immediately seen. Including changing objects.
		>>I think this bug was in the plot readouts.
.	Reset should reset everything (including heat, object, time, graphs, controls, friction, frictionless checkbox).
		>>Fixed this for plot & bar graph states, and the frictionless checkbox.
.	Improve the drawing order of the graph lines (applied on top).
		>>I�ve simply increased the stroke size for the applied force plot.  Looks ok.
.	Bugfix: After 30 seconds, you can still press record, but nothing records.
.	Bugfix: On playback, sometimes the block jumps around (wrong surface data?)
.	Friction arrows aren�t updating after time runs out.
		>>I can�t reproduce this.

.	Audio checkbox is on the right, titled 'Sound'.
.	Wall force is brown.
.	Sleepy dog is back.
.	Different audio for run-over man.
.	Applied force label is above applied force spinner.
.	Moved the 'overheat message' to the bar graph area, only appears if bar graphs are up
.	Renamed 'clear heat' to 'remove heat' in the control panel.
.	Height readout is now halfway down, with 'height extent' lines.
.	Changed the verify dialog text to clarify the difference between "Clear Graphs" and "Reset Everything"
.	Added Go Pause Clear buttons to the control panel (near the position & angle controls)

New in theramp 0.19 on 10-9-2005
�	Bugfix: the ramp no longer mistakenly starts overheated on replay.
�	Wall force color has been changed to avoid clashing with the normal force color.

�	The ramp starts at a slight angle.
�	There is a checkbox to enable the draggable zero-point potential graphic, now only available in the advanced panel.
�	The graph vertical axes are now labeled.
�	The Advanced function of showing multiple forces now adds labels to each entry (for disambiguation).
�	The man no longer screams.
�	Labels and numbers no longer cover graph area.
.	Added a mute button.

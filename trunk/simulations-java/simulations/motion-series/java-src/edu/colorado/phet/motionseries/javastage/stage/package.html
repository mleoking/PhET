<body>This package (primarily StageCanvas) provides direct support for the three coordinate frames typically used in PhET simulations, the
model, stage and screen coordinate frames. Many clients will just use the StageCanvas class, other classes in this
package are predominantly supporting classes of StageCanvas (unless custom behavior is required).

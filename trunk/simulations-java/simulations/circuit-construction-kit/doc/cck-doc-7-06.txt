Voltage chart
2-terminal version of the current meter.
inductors should auto-discharge when not in a loop.
capacitor charges should be blue for negative, red for +
square plates in 3d
area is a function of capacitance.
floating graph needs units
quantitative CCK can wait until after AAPT
editing an inductor or capacitor should take effect immediately
red 'x' for charts
floatable timer
in meeting, time-series charts looked non-smooth for simple AC RC circuit

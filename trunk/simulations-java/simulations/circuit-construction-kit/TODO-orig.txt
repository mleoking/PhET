Kathy's New bugs/fixes:
- the non-contact ammeter is ~50% larger than the old CCK version. 
Please match the old size.

- I like the look (font, slider) of the voltage adjustment window and 
right-click drop down menu on the old CCK version better than the new 
version ... was that change associated with going to picolo?

- Switch needs to be *in front* of wires ... otherwise the switch 
gets obsured by wires. (it is correct on old version). In old 
version, wires were also behind bulbs (always) where as now they can 
obscure bulb.

- When has complex circuit... sim doesn't refresh correctly when 
"unhidden" ... that is when minimizing a window that is in front of 
sim to reveal sim. (Only part with moving electrons refreshes under 
these conditions).

- When sim has a lot of circuits going ... the right click window 
does not get drawn correctly ... nothing appears in the window.

- Is there a way to have the computer detect when the sim is 
completely obscured by another window, and then make it stop running 
at that point ... right now to get it to stop you have to minimize.

I’m having some problem saving sim files, though. No dialogue box 
appears to save, or re-save files with. Could this be a bug in the upgrade?

Bug Report 7-12-2007
I did the experiment and it is not working - lets say the timer constant was .5 seconds and got 5 seconds.
The current changes with time as expected (exponential) but the measure values are almost ten times bigger.

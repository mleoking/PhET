Voltage chart reads wrong value after switching sizes

Inductor & capacitor incorrectly readout ohms, not Henries & Farads

Change in AC Frequency shows readout for voltage.

Noncontact ammeter doesn't update its reading when wire resistivity changes.

He had a circuit partially built, then tried to undo something by reflexively hitting Ctrl-Z.
His circuit dissappear, and was replaced by a battery and a resistor with electrons flowing in both directions through them.
I tested this on my PC, and the same thing happened.
This test behaviour should be taken out.

He would like to be able to reduce the number of significant figures in the ammeter
so that the resistance in the wires doesn't keep the numbers from looking perfect when he
constructs simple circuits. He said that when he first builds a simple parallel circuit, he would
like the currents to look exactly the same in both branches. With three decimal places, they don't,
and he has to explain it at a time when he'd rather not.

Get the time units to work out correctly.

o Is the ac current (in a circuit with capacitor) symmetric?
    o If not, is the asymmetry correct?
-When you have an AC voltage source and a light bulb in series and turn the
frequency to 10 Hz, it looks like the current drifts slightly (counter
clockwise) as it oscillates back and forth.  I put the mouse cursor next to
one of the blue dots and watched how one particular blue dot moves over
time.  Every 10 secs or so, the current stutters ever so slightly and shifts
the current over.  This seems like a very small/minor problem, but I'm not
sure if it's effects can be easily seen with a more complicated circuit.

-When I have 2 caps in series with a bulb and battery and turned the voltage
up rather high, only one of the caps catches on fire (the one near the
battery).  See cck_fire.gif.
>>Couldn't reproduce this yet.

-There's a slight issues with the capacitors.  I charged up two identical
capacitor at different voltages (100 V and 10 V) so that there are different
amounts of charges on them.  Then, I removed the charged caps from their
circuits (see cck_caps_separate.gif).  I connected the positive side of one
cap to the negative side of the other cap.  I expected to see the charges on
these two connected plates redistribute themselves, but nothing happened.
(see cck_caps_together.gif).  When you connect the outside plates of this 2
cap combo with some wires, the charges on the plates then properly
distribute themselves.
>>Yes, this is a real problem I'm not sure is addressed by my circuit analysis.  I'm not sure whether my circuit analysis should be giving the right behavior here, or if we'll have to detect it and handle it separately.

-On that same note, when I had 2 independent charged capacitors (not
attached to anything else) it was sometimes hard to grab them with the
cursor and move them.  When you click on them, they would not be highlighted
in yellow like usual.

- Unfortunately performance is an issue ... it's pretty easy to get
to the point where the mouse isn't working well and it is frustrating
to build anything... is there any hope of improving this (ever)???
-I noticed the same performance issues as Kathy.  As soon as there were many
components in the play area, things got bogged down.
        Is this fixed in the piccolo version?

- is there any way to make the current graph smoother?  Right now it
shows features that aren't really there?

What should happen to the charge stored on a capacitor while the user is editing the capacitance?
- Changing capacitance still doesn't show the right thing ... it
doesn't show the electrons flowing again to fill up the plate with
more or less charge.
>>Yes, I thought it would be awkward to keep the charge constant
across the capacitor while editing the capicatance
(which would be implemented by manipulating the potential drop to
account for the difference).
The potential drop is constantly changing,
based on other elements in the circuit, and I'm not sure of a good way to
account for both of these issues.

- I ran across a weird bug, (see attached). I had a nice looking
circuit and when I was trying to add a bulb to it, it was sort of
bogging down as I was dragging the bulb, and then all of a sudden it
collapsed to one line, as shown and totally changed the components in
the circuit (?). Do you have a short cut of keys that I may have pushed?
>>I hope this problem will disappear when CCK is moved to piccolo.
        Has this problem disappeared in the piccolo rewrite?

  There is something I noticed a while ago and forgot to mention.  On CCK there is a clear button and it’s in a tool cluster labeled ‘File’;
  however, it’s job is that of reset and brings the sim back to it’s initial setup.  Can you call it reset and move it out of that tool cluster?
  It came up today because it caused confusion for an individual using it in the booth.
>>Asking for clarification.
  Circuit does fit better.  I’m not crazy about requiring labels on all these clusters however on Advanced, it is necessary unless you replace Enable
  with Advanced.  Deleting these cluster titles may be especially helpful in AC CCK if you’re running out of room.  What do you think?
            Retitle the top tool cluster from "File" to "Circuit" in the control panel.

Froze at Merlot talk.

While working on the interview paper Carl thought of a possible addition to CCK.
What do you think about adding a person who can be used to test out the physiological responses to electricity.
I’m not sure of the easiest way but he would have various reactions according the the stimulous.
If it were as simple as touching a battery to his tongue (maybe to hard to integrate into CCK)
he’d just jump a little and say something appropriate, as the shock gets stronger he may say ouch
and finally it might just turn into a pile of black ashes or something.  Problems to think about are
making it too much fun and CCK is already very full.  Possibly put him in the advanced panel.
We came up with this because one of the benefits of simulations is being able to take risks
without negative consequences and when students study electricity this is one of the most engaging
topics and in lab students are quite often afraid of electrocuting themselves.  What do you think?

inductors should auto-discharge when not in a loop
capacitor area should be a function of capacitance

o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

There is a noticeable delay when dragging a component from the toolbox for the first time; this has confused some users.

Bug: capacitor clips are clipping all electrons, not just electrons in that branch of the circuit

Explain and remove fudge factor for capacitor in MNASolution?

-If you build a simple circuit (battery, resistor, capacitor, and wires in
series) and wiggle an element or node back and forth around with the mouse,
the blue balls stop flowing from a node 2 or 3 nodes clock-wise from the
element or node you are moving around.  The blue balls stop flowing through
this particular node, but the rest keep on flowing, so you get a wire or
element with an absence of blue balls because they all flow out.  This may
be due to the fact that the wire has to redraw the number of blue balls
because wiggling an element or node changes the number of blue balls
(according to its length).

o Set node voltages from the MNA, then use that to compute voltmeter readouts (instead of complex and error-prone graph theory computation).

Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.

-When there were two circuits running in the play area, there was
definitely a decrease in performance and things ran a bit slower.  If you
grab a wire, say, from the tool bar and drag it around in the play area,
there is a noticeable lag between the cursor and the wire moving with it.

-When you have 2 caps in the play area and you turn one of them 180 degrees
around, it looks a little strange next to the other one that has not been
turned around--sort of an MC Escher effect.  See cck_escher.gif.

-I noticed the same performance issues as Kathy.  As soon as there were many

-I noticed the plus and minus signs on the caps are sometimes near other
objects (when there are only 3 charges present) and it makes it hard to see
them.  Possibly the charges could be moved a few pixels away from other
objects? (see cck_charge_signs.gif)

I played around with this version (3.01.07) and found a few interesting
things.

-When the frequency is turned up to 10 Hz, you don't see the stuttering of
the light rays from a light bulb anymore.

-The current plots on the strip chart recorders do look smoother than before
when the frequency and voltage are turned up, but there is still a slight
kink in the plot every so often (see attached picture).  When I added a
similar circuit to the play area (so that there are two different circuits
running), the plot on the strip chart doesn't get any worse.

-However, when there were two circuits running in the play area, there was
definitely a decrease in performance and things ran a bit slower.  If you
grab a wire, say, from the tool bar and drag it around in the play area,
there is a noticeable lag between the cursor and the wire moving with it.

the current over.  This seems like a very small/minor problem, but I'm not
sure if it's effects can be easily seen with a more complicated circuit.

-If you hook a battery and light bulb up to a resistor in series, charge the
capacitor, and then disconnect the capacitor from the circuit and move the
charged capacitor around, it leaves a trail of + and - around in the play
area.  The capacitor still remains charged though.

- Unfortunately performance is an issue ... it's pretty easy to get
to the point where the mouse isn't working well and it is frustrating
to build anything... is there any hope of improving this (ever)???

I recently made the observation that in an RL circuit in the CCK, after letting the current reach the steady state, if you remove a wire or the battery, then the electrons oscillate in the inductor.  This is the result from the time dependent circuit analysis, and it has taken me some time to understand the physical reason for this.

First, the induced EMF (voltage drop, for an ideal inductor) is proportional to the time-derivative of the current through the inductor.  Therefore in the instance in which the circuit is stopped instantly, we analytically obtain an infinite voltage drop across the inductor.

Second, Capacitors and Inductors are both energy-storage components, storing their energy in the electric field and magnetic field, respectively.  When the RL circuit is broken, the magnetic energy stored in the ideal inductor is not dissipated, and indeed if you reconnect the circuit (without a battery), the steady-state current continues through the circuit.

This looks like an appropriate way to handle ideal inductors, but there are a few caveats:
1. It looks weird to visualize the stored energy inside an inductor as oscillating electrons.  I'm sure this will raise lots of questions that might distract from the learning goals of the simulation.
2. I don’t think this would happen in real life; I think a real-life inductor would dissipate its energy, though I'm not sure of the mechanism or rate for this.

Here are some references to address the latter caveat:
http://techlib.com/craig/switching.htm
>>At the bottom is a proposed model of a real world (nonideal) inductor.  Maybe we should model something like this.
http://www.play-hookey.com/dc_theory/rl_circuits.html
>>This page presents as a believable mechanism, might be good to model.  See the paragraph associated with the last figure.

Despite the caveats and what would happen in real life, it may be good to show the ideal case, and depict it as we currently do (this solution would certainly be the easiest to implement.)

Please let me know how you to treat inductors in this circumstance.

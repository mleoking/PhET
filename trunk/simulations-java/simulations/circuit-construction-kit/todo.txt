Keep track of the dt from each time step to the next to avoid work where possible.

JB: Fix: Non-contact Ammeter reading changes at junction.
> Maybe defer these to post processing:
Limit rate of reading changes from the voltmeter and ammeters to one/500ms.  Should be easy to change this rate in the code (a constant).
Limit rate of value changes from the batteries and resistors to one/500ms.  Should be easy to change this rate in the code (a constant).
JB: As Kathy said, we are mainly concerned with finding out that current changed. Every change in the circuit will imply a current change in the battery. Then, perhaps it is not crucial to know which component changed its current - most likely, all connected components do. Thus, logging current change on the battery seems sufficient. Does this make sense?

2nd Priority (wait until confirming top priority with Ido)
Current change message for each component excluding wires (limit to every 500ms) [On hold for now based on 2/15/2013 email from Ido]

Component name from grab bag is sending duplicate "user" message, could be fixed in Circuit if necessary, see this todo: //TODO: Could add grab bag component type here by casting to GrabBagResistor and getting info

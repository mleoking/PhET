Keep track of the dt from each time step to the next to avoid work where possible.

Sim Sharing items:

Top Priority

Voltage editor dialog window activated/deactivated.
Make the log voltage match the voltmeter voltage by using a number formatter.
Time limit voltage messages from voltmeter.
Time limit current messages from ammeters.
Series ammeter - value thresholding so that sim sharing messages are only sent when the readout seen by the user changes.
Voltmeter - value thresholding so that sim sharing messages are only sent when the readout seen by the user changes.
Non-contact ammeter - value thresholding so that sim sharing messages are only sent when the readout seen by the user changes.
Series ammeter - Make the model ID match the user ID (there is a method for getting model ID on the Branch class now).
Switch open/closure messages.
Under the "Advanced" controls: Wire resistivity - Instrument as done for the other sliders, i.e. need start drag, drag (time limited), and end drag.
Location on screen where components are moved to as a parameter of the "moved" message (only do if easy)

Sighting: Odd behavior from the non-contact ammeter. We seemed to see messages from it when it wasn't in the circuit.

JB: Fix: Non-contact Ammeter reading changes at junction.

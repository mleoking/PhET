When battery right click menu appears, it was sending user voltageEditor message.  It would be ok if that happened when editor shows, but not just when the right click menu.
When "more volts" gets checked it should not send "user voltageEditor" changed message.
Location on screen where components are moved to as a parameter of the "moved" message (only do if easy)
Get rid of message about nonContactAmmeter reported at startup.
nonContactAmmeterModel measuredCurrent changed even when non contact ammeter not present, seems to give extra messages

Sighting: Odd behavior from the non-contact ammeter. We seemed to see messages from it when it wasn't in the circuit.

JB: Fix: Non-contact Ammeter reading changes at junction.

Keep track of the dt from each time step to the next to avoid work where possible.

Sim Sharing items:

Top Priority

JB: Fix: Non-contact Ammeter reading changes at junction.
SR: Checkboxes and buttons
SR: Flame message
SR: Rotation/endpoint movement
SR: Configured value (battery voltage, resistance) changed (limit to every 500ms)
SR and JB: Go over TODOs added by JB.
> Maybe defer these to post processing:
Limit rate of reading changes from the voltmeter and ammeters to one/500ms.  Should be easy to change this rate in the code (a constant).
Limit rate of value changes from the batteries and resistors to one/500ms.  Should be easy to change this rate in the code (a constant).

2nd Priority (wait until confirming top priority with Ido)
SR: Activate/deactivate messages for the instruments (non-contact ammeter, voltage probes).  Activate on mouse down, deactivate on mouse up.
SR: Voltmeter/Ammeter - message includes the component or components to which they are connected.
Current change message for each component excluding wires (limit to every 500ms) [On hold for now based on 2/15/2013 email from Ido]

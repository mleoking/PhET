1. Package structure
Package structure should be sims/modules.  For instance, it the game view package is currently at:
view/game

But it should be at:
modules/game/view

I know there is some contention about how to structure packages--in a discussion with JB today, he said he prefers "modules/game/view" structure, but in previous
conversations with JO I think JO favored the view/game layout.  We should discuss this.

I'd also recommend putting all the developer code in a /dev or /test package

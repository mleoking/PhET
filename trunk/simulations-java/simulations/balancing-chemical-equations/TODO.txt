TODO list for balancing-chemical-equations

DESIGN ISSUES
- should boxes contain "molecules are hidden" when Options->Show molecules is deselected? (ala RPAL)
- create more balanced atom piles, add atoms along RTL diagonal?
- should Reset All prompt for confirmation?
- which representations are needed for Game, and how will they all fit in the play area?

HIGH PRIORITY

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- PNode.toImage looks lousy for atoms and molecules
- "Game" module with 2/3/11 design meeting changes
- in "Game", two possible labels below frowny face: "X not balanced" or "Check Mark balanced\nX not simplified"
- after "Check" is pressed, show bar charts or balance scales in a popup that obscures part of play area and has a "Try Again" or "Next" button and face.

LOW PRIORITY
- generate molecule symbols based on ordered list of atoms, or at least compare molecule symbol to atom list to catch bugs

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ConstrainedProperty, ConstrainedIntegerProperty, ConstrainedDoubleProperty
- GameSettings

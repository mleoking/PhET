TODO list for balancing-chemical-equations

DESIGN ISSUES
- which representations are needed for Game, and how will they all fit in the play area?
- N and P look the same to colorblind
- Cl, F and S look the same to colorblind

HIGH PRIORITY
- "Game" module with 2/3/11 design meeting changes
- in "Game", two possible labels below frowny face: "X not balanced" or "Check Mark balanced\nX not simplified"
- after "Check" is pressed, show bar charts or balance scales in a popup that obscures part of play area and has a "Try Again" or "Next" button and face.

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- change molecules, per KL
- PNode.toImage looks lousy for atoms and molecules

LOW PRIORITY

MIGRATE TO COMMON

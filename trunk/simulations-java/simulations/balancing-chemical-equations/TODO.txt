TODO list of balancing-chemical-equations

DESIGN ISSUES
- should bar charts show "=" when all coefficients are zero?
- should boxes contain "molecules are hidden" when Options->Show molecules is deselected? (ala RPAL)
- create more balanced atom piles, add atoms along RTL diagonal?
- should Reset All prompt for confirmation?
- should Reset All in any tab reset Options->Show molecules?
- which representations are needed for Game, and how will they all fit in the play area?

HIGH PRIORITY
- publish dev version for discussion, with all features of the "Balance Equation" module

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- "Game" module
- pick a random representation for Game (bar chart, balance scale, molecules) then allow user to change via 3 radio buttons
- in "Game", two possible labels below frowny face: "X not balanced" or "Check Mark balanced\nX not simplified"

LOW PRIORITY
- how to reset global settings? (eg, Options->Show molecules)
- generate molecule symbols based on ordered list of atoms, or at least compare molecule symbol to atom list to catch bugs

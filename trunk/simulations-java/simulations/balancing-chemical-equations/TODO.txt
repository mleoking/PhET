TODO list of balancing-chemical-equations

DESIGN ISSUES
- which representations are needed for Game, and how will they all fit in the play area?

HIGH PRIORITY
- tilt of balance scales
- global Options menu item to show/hide molecules in both tabs
- horizontal alignment of various views
- publish dev version for discussion with all features of the "Balance Equation" module

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- "Game" module
- pick a random representation for Game (bar chart, balance scale, molecules) then allow user to change via 3 radio buttons
- in "Game", two possible labels below frowny face: "X not balanced" or "Check Mark balanced\nX not simplified"
- tilt of balance scale: compute N = left - right. Choose some N that hits the ground, have scale N angles.
- OK to overlap molecules on balance scale (range is 0-60)

LOW PRIORITY
- generate molecule symbols based on ordered list of atoms, or at least compare molecule symbol to atom list to catch bugs

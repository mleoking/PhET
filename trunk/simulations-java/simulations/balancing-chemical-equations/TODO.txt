TODO list for balancing-chemical-equations

DESIGN ISSUES
- which representations are needed for Game, and how will they all fit in the play area?

HIGH PRIORITY
- Game: reward for perfect score
- Game: rewrite GameScoreBoardNode to use Property<T>
- Game: rewrite GameOverNode to use Property<T>

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Game: on incorrect guess, show bar charts or balance scales in a popup that obscures part of play area and has a "Try Again" or "Next" button and face.
- C2H5OH symbol overlaps "+" sign in equation (smaller font? different layout?...)
- rename package module.balanceequation to module.introduction

LOW PRIORITY
- delete TestMoleculeNodes from build properties before publishing 1.00

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- replace molecule image files in RPAL with Piccolo code from BCE

TODO list for balancing-chemical-equations

DESIGN ISSUES
- which representations are needed for Game, and how will they all fit in the play area?

HIGH PRIORITY
- rename GamePrompt to GameState, document the approach used in Game
- add scales/bars to "balanced, not simplified" popup
- rename package module.balanceequation to module.introduction
- rename package module.balanceequation to module.introduction
- Game: reward for perfect score
- implement "Hide molecules" feature for Game

MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Game: rewrite GameScoreBoardNode to use Property<T>
- Game: rewrite GameOverNode to use Property<T>

LOW PRIORITY
- delete TestMoleculeNodes from build properties before publishing 1.00

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- replace molecule image files in RPAL with Piccolo code from BCE

/**
 * <b>PPickPath</b> represents a ordered list of nodes that have been picked. 
 * The topmost ancestor node is the first node in the list (and should be a camera), 
 * the bottommost child node is at the end of the list. It is this bottom node that 
 * is given first chance to handle events, and that any active event handlers usually
 * manipulate.
 * <p>
 * Note that because of layers (which can be picked by multiple camera's) the ordered
 * list of nodes in a pick path do not all share a parent child relationship with the
 * nodes in the list next to them. This means that the normal localToGlobal methods don't
 * work when trying to transform geometry up and down the pick path, instead you should
 * use the pick paths canvasToLocal methods to get the mouse event points into your local
 * coord system.
 * <p>
 * Note that PInputEvent wraps most of the useful PPickPath methods, so often you
 * can use a PInputEvent directly instead of having to access its pick path.

/**
 * <b>PPathActivity</b> is the abstract base class for all path activity
 * interpolators. Path activities interpolate between multiple states over the
 * duration of the activity.
 * <p>
 * Knots are used to determine when in time the activity should move from state
 * to state. Knot values should be increasing in value from 0 to 1 inclusive.
 * This class is based on the Java 3D PathInterpolator object, see that class
 * documentation for more information on the basic concepts used in this classes
 * design.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See PPositionPathActivity for a concrete path activity that will animate
 * through a list of points.

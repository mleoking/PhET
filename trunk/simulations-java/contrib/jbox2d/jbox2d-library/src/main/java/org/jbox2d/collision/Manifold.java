/**
 * A manifold for two touching convex shapes.
 * Box2D supports multiple types of contact:
 * <ul>
 * <li>clip point versus plane with radius</li>
 * <li>point versus point with radius (circles)</li>
 * </ul>
 * The local point usage depends on the manifold type:
 * <ul>
 * <li>e_circles: the local center of circleA</li>
 * <li>e_faceA: the center of faceA</li>
 * <li>e_faceB: the center of faceB</li>
 * </ul>
 * Similarly the local normal usage:
 * <ul>
 * <li>e_circles: not used</li>
 * <li>e_faceA: the normal on polygonA</li>
 * <li>e_faceB: the normal on polygonB</li>
 * </ul>
 * We store contacts in this way so that position correction can
 * account for movement, which is critical for continuous physics.
 * All contact scenarios must be expressed in one of these types.
 * This structure is stored across time steps, so we keep it small.

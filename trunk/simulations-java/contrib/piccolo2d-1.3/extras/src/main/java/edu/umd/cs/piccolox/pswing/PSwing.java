 -----------------------------------------------

 We are currently developing Piccolo, a "scenegraph" for use in 2D graphics.
 One of our ultimate goals is to support Swing lightweight components
 within Piccolo, whose graphical space supports arbitray affine transforms.
 The challenge in this pursuit is getting the components to respond and
 render properly though not actually displayed in a standard Java component
 hierarchy.


 The first issues involved making the Swing components focusable and
 showing.  This was accomplished by adding the Swing components to a 0x0
 JComponent which was in turn added to our main Piccolo application component.
 To our good fortune, a Java component is showing merely if it and its
 ancestors are showing and not based on whether it is ACTUALLY visible.
 Likewise, focus in a JComponent depends merely on the component's
 containing window having focus.


 The second issue involved capturing the repaint calls on a Swing
 component.  Normally, for a repaint and the consequent call to
 paintImmediately, a Swing component obtains the Graphics object necessary
 to render itself through the Java component heirarchy.  However, for Piccolo
 we would like the component to render using a Graphics object that Piccolo
 may have arbitrarily transformed in some way.  By capturing in the
 RepaintManager the repaint calls made on our special Swing components, we
 are able to redirect the repaint requests through the Piccolo architecture to
 put the Graphics in its proper context.  Unfortunately, this means that
 if the Swing component contains other Swing components, then any repaint
 requests made by one of these nested components must go through
 the Piccolo architecture then through the top level Swing component
 down to the nested Swing component.  This normally doesn't cause a
 problem.  However, if calling paint on one of these nested
 children causes a call to repaint then an infinite loop ensues.  This does
 in fact happen in the Swing components that use cell renderers.  Before
 the cell renderer is painted, it is invalidated and consequently
 repainted.  We solved this problem by putting a lock on repaint calls for
 a component while that component is painting.  (A similar problem faced
 the Swing team over this same issue.  They solved it by inserting a
 CellRendererPane to capture the renderer's invalidate calls.)


 Another issue arose over the forwarding of mouse events to the Swing
 components.  Since our Swing components are not actually displayed on
 screen in the standard manner, we must manually dispatch any MouseEvents
 we want the component to receive.  Hence, we needed to find the deepest
 visible component at a particular location that accepts MouseEvents.
 Finding the deepest visible component at a point was achieved with the
 "findComponentAt" method in java.awt.Container.  With the
 "getListeners(Class listenerType)" method added in JDK1.3 Beta we are able
 to determine if the component has any Mouse Listeners. However, we haven't
 yet found a way to determine if MouseEvents have been specifically enabled
 for a component. The package private method "eventEnabled" in
 java.awt.Component does exactly what we want but is, of course,
 inaccessible.  In order to dispatch events correctly we would need a
 public accessor to the method "boolean eventEnabled(AWTEvent)" in
 java.awt.Component.


 Still another issue involves the management of cursors when the mouse is
 over a Swing component in our application.  To the Java mechanisms, the
 mouse never appears to enter the bounds of the Swing components since they
 are contained by a 0x0 JComponent.  Hence, we must manually change the
 cursor when the mouse enters one of the Swing components in our
 application. This generally works but becomes a problem if the Swing
 component's cursor changes while we are over that Swing component (for
 instance, if you resize a Table Column).  In order to manage cursors
 properly, we would need setCursor to fire property change events.


 With the above fixes, most Swing components work.  The only Swing
 components that are definitely broken are ToolTips and those that rely on
 JPopupMenu. In order to implement ToolTips properly, we would need to have
 a method in ToolTipManager that allows us to set the current manager, as
 is possible with RepaintManager.  In order to implement JPopupMenu, we
 will likely need to re-implement JPopupMenu to function in Piccolo2d with
 a transformed Graphics and to insert itself in the proper place in the
 Piccolo2d scenegraph.

/**
 * <b>PSwing</b> is used to add Swing Components to a Piccolo2D canvas.
 * <p>
 * Example: adding a swing JButton to a PCanvas:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PSwingCanvas canvas = new PSwingCanvas();
 * JButton button = new JButton(&quot;Button&quot;);
 * swing = new PSwing(canvas, button);
 * canvas.getLayer().addChild(swing);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * NOTE: PSwing has the current limitation that it does not listen for Container
 * events. This is only an issue if you create a PSwing and later add Swing
 * components to the PSwing's component hierarchy that do not have double
 * buffering turned off or have a smaller font size than the minimum font size
 * of the original PSwing's component hierarchy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For instance, the following bit of code will give unexpected results:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * JPanel panel = new JPanel();
 * PSwing swing = new PSwing(panel);
 * JPanel newChild = new JPanel();
 * newChild.setDoubleBuffered(true);
 * panel.add(newChild);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: PSwing cannot be correctly interacted with through multiple cameras.
 * There is no support for it yet.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: PSwing is java.io.Serializable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Piccolo releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for
 * short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of
 * Piccolo. A future release of Piccolo will provide support for long term
 * persistence.

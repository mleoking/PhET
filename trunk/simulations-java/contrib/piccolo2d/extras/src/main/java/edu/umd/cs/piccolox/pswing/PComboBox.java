/**
 * The <b>PComboBox</b> is used instead of a JComboBox in a Piccolo scene graph.
 * This PComboBox won't work properly if it is located in an abnormal hierarchy
 * of Cameras. Support is provided for only one (or zero) view transforms.
 * <p>
 * A ComboBox for use in Piccolo. This still has an associated JPopupMenu (which
 * is always potentially heavyweight depending on component location relative to
 * containing window borders.) However, this ComboBox places the PopupMenu
 * component of the ComboBox in the appropriate position relative to the
 * permanent part of the ComboBox. The PopupMenu is never transformed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class was not designed for subclassing. If different behavior is
 * required, it seems more appropriate to subclass JComboBox directly using this
 * class as a model.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: There is currently a known bug, namely, if the ComboBox receives focus
 * through 'tab' focus traversal and the keyboard is used to interact with the
 * ComboBox, there may be unexpected results.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Piccolo releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for
 * short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of
 * Piccolo. A future release of Piccolo will provide support for long term
 * persistence.

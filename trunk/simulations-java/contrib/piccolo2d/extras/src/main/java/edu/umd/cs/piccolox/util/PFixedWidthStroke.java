/**
 * <b>PFixedWidthStroke</b> is the same as {@link BasicStroke} except that
 * PFixedWidthStroke has a fixed width on the screen so that even when the
 * canvas view is zooming its width stays the same in canvas coordinates.
 * <p>
 * {@link #createStrokedShape(Shape)} checks if the scale has changed since the
 * last usage and if that's the case calls {@link #newStroke(float)} to get a
 * new {@link Stroke} instance to delegate to.
 * <p>
 * <b>CAUTION!</b> this implementation falls short for large scaling factors -
 * the effective miterlimit might drop below 1.0 which isn't permitted by
 * {@link BasicStroke} and therefore limited to a minimal 1.0 by this
 * implementation. A more sophisticated implementation might use the approach
 * mentioned at http://code.google.com/p/piccolo2d/issues/detail?id=49
 * <p>
 * <b>CAUTION!</b> after extreme scaling this implementation seems to change to
 * internal state of the base stroke. Try PathExample with extreme zoom in and
 * zoom back to the original scale. The pickable circles disappear. Strange!

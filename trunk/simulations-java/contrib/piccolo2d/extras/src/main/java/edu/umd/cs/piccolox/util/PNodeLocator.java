/**
 * <b>PNodeLocator</b> provides an abstraction for locating points on a node.
 * Points are located in the local corrdinate system of the node. The default
 * behavior is to locate the center point of the nodes bounds. The node where
 * the point is located is stored internal to this locator (as an instance
 * varriable). If you want to use the same locator to locate center points on
 * many different nodes you will need to call setNode() before asking for each
 * location.

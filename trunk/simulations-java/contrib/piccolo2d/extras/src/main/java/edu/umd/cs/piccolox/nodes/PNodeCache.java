/**
 * <b>PNodeCache</b> caches a visual representation of it's children into an
 * image and uses this cached image for painting instead of painting it's
 * children directly. This is intended to be used in two ways.
 * <p>
 * First it can be used as a simple optimization technique. If a node has many
 * descendents it may be faster to paint the cached image representation instead
 * of painting each node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Second PNodeCache provides a place where "image" effects such as blurring and
 * drop shadows can be added to the Piccolo scene graph. This can be done by
 * overriding the method createImageCache and returing an image with the desired
 * effect applied.

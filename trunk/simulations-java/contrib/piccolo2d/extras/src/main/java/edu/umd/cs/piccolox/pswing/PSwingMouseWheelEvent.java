/**
 * <b>PMouseMotionEvent</b> is an event which indicates that a mouse motion
 * action occurred in a node.
 * <p/>
 * This low-level event is generated by a node object for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Mouse Motion Events
 * <ul>
 * <li>the mouse is moved
 * <li>the mouse is dragged
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * A PMouseEvent object is passed to every <code>PMouseMotionListener</code> or
 * <code>PMouseMotionAdapter</code> object which registered to receive mouse
 * motion events using the component's <code>addMouseMotionListener</code>
 * method. (<code>PMouseMotionAdapter</code> objects implement the
 * <code>PMouseMotionListener</code> interface.) Each such listener object gets
 * a <code>PMouseEvent</code> containing the mouse motion event.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Warning:</b> Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Piccolo releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for
 * short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of
 * Piccolo. A future release of Piccolo will provide support for long term
 * persistence.

/**
 * <b>ZoomEventhandler</b> provides event handlers for basic zooming of the
 * canvas view with the right (third) button. The interaction is that the
 * initial mouse press defines the zoom anchor point, and then moving the mouse
 * to the right zooms with a speed proportional to the amount the mouse is moved
 * to the right of the anchor point. Similarly, if the mouse is moved to the
 * left, the the view is zoomed out.
 * <P>
 * On a Mac with its single mouse button one may wish to change the standard
 * right mouse button zooming behavior. This can be easily done with the
 * PInputEventFilter. For example to zoom with button one and shift you would do
 * this:
 * <P>
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * zoomEventHandler.getEventFilter().setAndMask(InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK | 
 *                                              InputEvent.SHIFT_MASK);
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * <P>

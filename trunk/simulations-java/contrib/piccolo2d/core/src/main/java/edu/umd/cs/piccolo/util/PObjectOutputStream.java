/**
 * <b>PObjectOutputStream</b> is an extension of ObjectOutputStream to handle
 * optional elements. This is similar to the concept of Java's
 * "weak references", but applied to object serialization rather than garbage
 * collection. Here, PObjectOutputStream provides a method,
 * <code>writeConditionalObject</code>, which only serializes the specified
 * object to the stream if there is a strong reference (if it has been written
 * somewhere else using writeObject()) to that object elsewhere in the stream.
 * <p>
 * To discover strong references to objects, PObjectOutputStream uses a
 * two-phase writing process. First, a "discovery" phase is used to find out
 * what objects are about to be serialized. This works by effectively
 * serializing the object graph to /dev/null, recording which objects are
 * unconditionally written using the standard writeObject method. Then, in the
 * second "write" phase, ObjectOutputStream actually serializes the data to the
 * output stream. During this phase, calls to writeConditionalObject() will only
 * write the specified object if the object was found to be serialized during
 * the discovery stage. If the object was not recorded during the discovery
 * stage, a an optional null (the default) is unconditionally written in place
 * of the object. To skip writting out the null use
 * <code>writeConditionalObject(object, false)</code>
 * <p>
 * By careful implementation of readObject and writeObject methods, streams
 * serialized using PObjectOutputStream can be deserialized using the standard
 * ObjectInputStream.

The example directory contains:
viewerserver.war (War File containing a web server app + viewer applet)

The war file should be easily deployable to any modern Java App Server Container
(Tomcat, WebLogic etc..). 

Included in the example app are two sample objects demonstrating functionality:
cube.xml (5 cubes, 2 annotations, Several actions)

  - Clicking on "Menu of things to do" shows popup menu of actions
    - Goto MSNBC (URL Action)
    - Goto Daeron.com (URL Action)
    - Load Car (Load-Geom Action)
    - Hide/Show Cube Faces/Edges (Appearance Action)
    - Get Info (Server Action)

  - Clicking on "All paths lead to GOOGLE" (URL Action)

  - Clicking on the smaller cube in the back triggers a URL action

  Follow the "Edit Cube Annotations" link from the main index
  page and the applet will appear with editor functionality.
  Choose "Annotations" from the Modes menu.
  You should now be able to add new annotations or edit
  existing annotations by clicking on the object(s) in the
  scene.

car-outline.xml (Previous dataset now annotated + actions)
  There are two annotations with attached URL actions.

Follow the instructions here and on the object viewing pages to
test viewer functionality and applet/server messaging.

The source code in the server consists of two servlets:

DisplayObjectServlet - This servlet displays the applet,
                       tells the applet which object to load and
                       also tells it how to communicate with the
                       server.

AcceptMessageServlet - This servlet is on the receiving end
                       of messages sent from the applet. Currently
                       all it does it display each message to your
                       web server console using System.out.println

GenerateObjectServlet - This servlet generates an annotation geom
                        dynamically and is used to demonstrate server
                        actions.

Current messages generated by the applet are:

hello (generated when the applet is loaded/displayed)
print (generated when the user presses the 'P' key)
annotation (generated when user creates an annotation)
action (generated when user triggers a server action)

 * <b>PNotification</b> objects encapsulate information so that it can be

 * a name, an object, and an optional properties map. The name is a tag
 * identifying the notification. The object is any object that the poster of the
 * notification wants to send to observers of that notification (typically, it
 * is the object that posted the notification). The properties map stores other
 * related objects, if any.
 * <p>
 * You don't usually create your own notifications directly. The

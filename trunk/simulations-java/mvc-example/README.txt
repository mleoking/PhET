mvc-example

This example demonstrates two approaches for connecting components
in an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.

Approach A uses the Observer pattern, as implemented by java.util.Observable.
All classes with an 'A' prefix are related to this method.

Approach B uses relection as implemented by DynamicControllerListener.
All classes with a 'B' prefix are related to this method.

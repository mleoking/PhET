<h2>Main</h2>

<p class="intro">
<b>ProGuard</b> is a free Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and
preverifier. It detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and
attributes. It optimizes bytecode and removes unused instructions. It renames
the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short meaningless names.
Finally, it preverifies the processed code for Java 6 or for Java Micro
Edition.
</p>
Some uses of <b>ProGuard</b> are:
<ul>

<li>Creating more compact code, for smaller code archives, faster transfer
    across networks, faster loading, and smaller memory footprints.

<li>Making programs and libraries harder to reverse-engineer.

<li>Listing dead code, so it can be removed from the source code.

<li>Retargeting and preverifying existing class files for Java 6, to take full
    advantage of Java 6's faster class loading.

</ul>
<p>
<b>ProGuard</b>'s main advantage compared to other Java obfuscators is
probably its compact template-based configuration. A few intuitive command
line options or a simple configuration file are usually sufficient. For
instance, the following configuration option preserves all applets in a jar:
<pre>
    -keep public class * extends java.applet.Applet
</pre>
The user manual explains all available options and shows more examples of this
powerful configuration style.
<p>
<b>ProGuard</b> is fast. It only takes seconds to process programs and
libraries of several megabytes. The results section presents actual figures
for a number of applications.
<p>
<b>ProGuard</b> is a command-line tool with an optional graphical user
interface. It also comes with plugins for Ant and for the JME Wireless
Toolkit.
<p>
<p class="intro">
Version 4.0 introduced preverification and more bytecode optimizations. Please
report any problems, so they can be fixed soon.

Add clean functions
Add tasks to run/post/checkout simulations
Add task to build all simulations quickly (less duplication of work)
Add tasks to automatically manage and use revision numbers. (integrate with statistics task)
Clarify requirements for different parts of the build task (e.g. which strings must be in localization files)
Simplify build file
GUI for build process (display statistics, allow edit of simulation version (or title, etc), view simulations, build, launch, post simulations)?
Add tasks to facilitate posting on the main site?
Build task for gathering up all localization files for a project?
Statistics could include coverage for localization.
Clean up naming conventions for input variables to build.xml

Questions:
Should jnlp and jar files be checked in to subversion?
Should any build features be written outside of the ant task interface?
What is our timeline for per-simulation bitrock installer builders?  How will this relate to the build process?
Should build-all tasks work on a single project at a time or a single phase at a time?
Should properties be defined in build.xml or java files?

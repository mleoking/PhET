To compile the build process, put tools.jar in this directory (trunk\simulations-java\build-tools\sun-tools)
The tools.jar is not checked in due to licensing issues.

This is only necessary for Windows developers.  Mac developers use classes.jar instead of tools.jar.

In general, tools.jar can be found in JDK_HOME/lib/tools.jar, for example, I found mine at:
C:\j2sdk1.4.2_17\lib\tools.jar

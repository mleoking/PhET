Drawing the wave from a side view opens a different kind of can of worms.  It can be done, but main drawbacks are:
1. Difficult to program.
	a. drawing the 3d waves
	b. drawing the objects in the 3d system (detectors, barriers, etc.) and getting the coordinates correct.
2. Performance-intensive (remember some users don't have fast machines).
3. Not sure that this would benefit the student enough to justify the work.

Here's an implementation that uses one option for rendering 3-d waves (choose 'soft' viewer on startup, and spin the time slider to the right to get it going):
http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/geometrie/lab/ds.shtml

Looks okay to me, but not sure we can justify the work.  Maybe the correct way to gauge whether this is true is to do a student interview with the current version of Wave Interference and an interview with the linked simulation above, and see if there are great gains in having the full 3d view.  I'm not convinced it will make a huge difference (but could be wrong).

Okay, I'll add a switch to detectors to show intensity.  Do we want to optionally show absolute values (or intensities) in the wave area (to give a more global idea of constructive and destructive interference)?

Not sure what you mean by a sinewave of sound.  What did you think of the animation above as a side-view?

Okay, I'll leave it until we think of something better.

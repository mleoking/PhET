"To Do" list for "Optical Tweezers" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- optimize gradient view of laser power intensity using a BufferedImageOp that adjusts alpha channel

HIGH PRIORITY:
- bug: fluid viscosity slider is brain damaged
- implement force model for fast mode
- implement bead motion model
- implement E-field model for slow mode
- connect position histogram to model
- connect potential energy chart to model

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- vertical laser toggle button: http://www.bigstockphoto.com/thumbs/6/3/3/medium/336571.jpg
- try to make laser control panel draggable
- use proper plot type for PositionHistogramPlot
- careful! fluid speed is in microns (1E-6 m), everything else is in nm (1E-9 m)
- careful! Mike's laser intensity model uses mJ for power, everything else is in mW
- make viscosity control logarithimic
- accept multiple formats for entry of viscosity value (1E-10, 1e-10, 0.0001)
- cursors that indicate direction when drag is horizontally or vertically constrained
- units and range for fast speed [realtime* 10^-2, realtime]
- units and range for slow speed [realtime*140*10^-16, realtime*7*10^-16]
- clock speed control
- get spec for "Show change in momentum model" feature
- get spec for "Show charge on bead" feature

LOW PRIORITY:
- replace OTRuler alignment hack with permanent solution
- migrate CloseButtonNode to common, reuse phetcommon/data/images/buttons/closeButton.png
- add close button to ruler?
- get requirements for "Fun With DNA" and "Molecular Motors" panels
- save/load
- javadoc
- package level javadoc
- make laser danger sign look better
- combine Play & Pause clock buttons ?

CLEANUP:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size
- disable all debug output

DEFER UNTIL AFTER INTERVIEWS:

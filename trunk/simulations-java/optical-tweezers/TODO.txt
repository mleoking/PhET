"To Do" list for "Optical Tweezers" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- ruler can be dragged too far left, then pops back
- laser can be dragged too far left, then pops back
- change model coordinate system origin to be at center of laser's waist?
- position histogram
- potential energy chart
- E-field vectors
- fluid flow vectors
- charges on bead
- trap force on bead

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- cursors that indicate direction when drag is horizontally or vertically constrained
- javadoc what I've done so far
- wire up "Return Bead" button, visible only when bead is outside of canvas
- check bead visibility when canvas is resized, enable/disable "Return Bead" button
- check laser visibility when canvas is resized, move laser into visible area
- units and range for fast speed [realtime* 10^-2, realtime]
- units and range for slow speed [realtime*140*10^-16, realtime*7*10^-16]
- clock speed control
- units and range for fluid viscosity
- range for fluid temperature
- get spec for "Show change in momentum model" feature
- get spec for "Show charge on bead" feature

LOW PRIORITY:
- get requirements for "Fun With DNA" and "Molecular Motors" panels
- save/load
- green control panel background ala design doc
- package level javadoc
- make laser danger sign look better
- combine Play & Pause clock buttons ?
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size

DEFER UNTIL AFTER INTERVIEWS:

MODEL INFO NEEDED:
- Brownian motion of bead
- laser curvature
- laser gradient
- E-field
- trap force (slide 7)
- fluid drag force (slide 14)
- charge on the bead
- effect of temperature on Brownian motion
- position histogram (slide 15)
- stuff related to ÒShow change in momentum modelÓ (shape of 2 rays of light, vectors, etc.)
- units, ranges and default values for:
   + fluid flow speed
   + fluid viscosity
   + fluid temperature
   + clock dt

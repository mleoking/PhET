"To Do" list for "Optical Tweezers" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- fix vertical lines in laser control, attach to ends of objective, not the control panel
- fix problems with rulers
- fix problems with power slider (eg, type in "85" and it gets set to "80")
- straighten out lots of coordinate system transform problems

HIGH PRIORITY:
- no error dialog for power textfield input; if value is bad, beep and clamp to min/max
- laser dragging is messed up at left boundary
- position histogram
- potential energy chart
- E-field vectors
- fluid flow vectors
- charges on bead
- trap force on bead

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- cursors that indicate direction when drag is horizontally or vertically constrained
- get details of physical model
- javadoc what I've done so far
- wire up "Return Bead" button, visible only when bead is outside of canvas
- check bead visibility when canvas is resized
- check laser visibility when canvas is resized
- units and range for slow speed
- units and range for fast speed
- change clock speed control?
- units and range for flow speed
- units and range for fluid viscosity
- units and range for fluid temperature

LOW PRIORITY:
- remove CVS keywords from headers and javadoc
- generalize LaserPowerControl
- get requirements for "Fun With DNA" and "Molecular Motors" panels
- save/load for first module's control panel
- green control panel background ala design doc
- package level javadoc
- make laser danger sign look better
- combine Play & Pause clock buttons ?
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive nodes
- rescale image files to minimize file size

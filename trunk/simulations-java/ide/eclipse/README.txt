After checking out simulations-java, these files can be used to quickly configure Eclipse.

If you use Eclipse to alter these files, please copy the changed files
to this directory, so that other developers can take advantage of your work.

Follow these steps:

(1) copy dot-classpath to simulations-java/.classpath

(2) copy org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs to simulations-java/settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs

(3) Import the PhET code format conventions.
In Eclipse 3.3, got to Eclipse>Preferences>Java>Code Style>Formatter, then import phet-code-format.xml.

(4) Import the PhET code templates.
In Eclipse 3.3, got to Eclipse>Preferences>Java>Code Style>Code Templates, then import phet-code-templates.xml.

(5) Select simulations-java in the Package Explorer view, then refresh by pressing F5 or choose File>Refresh.
This tells Eclipse that files have been changed outside of Eclipse.

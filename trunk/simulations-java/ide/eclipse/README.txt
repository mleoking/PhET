These Eclipse files may or may not be specific to Chris Malley's development environment.

About the files...

classpath -
classpath should be copied to .classpath at the top level of your project.
For example, if you created a project named simulations-java, then you would:
cp simulations-java/ide/eclipse/classpath simulations-java/.classpath

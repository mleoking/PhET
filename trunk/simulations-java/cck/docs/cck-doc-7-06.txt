2. CCK
Voltage chart
2-terminal version of the current meter.
2-d capacitor for CCK

Document from McKagan.
inductors should auto-discharge when not in a loop.
capacitor charges should be blue for negative, red for +
square plates in 3d
area is a function of capacitance.
floating graph needs units
quantitative CCK can wait until after AAPT
editing an inductor or capacitor should take effect immediately
red 'x' for charts
floatable timer
Faraday's AC Source
in meeting, time-series charts looked non-smooth for simple AC RC circuit

I noticed that there is nothing in the window title of the various versions of CCK that distinguish the regular versions from the Virtual Lab versions. Also, the CCK DC+AC versions just say "Circuit Construction Kit III" in the window's title bar. I would probably be useful to have a more meaningful title.

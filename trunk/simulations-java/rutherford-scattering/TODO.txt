"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- making the energy control adjust the clock dt also means that the electron speed changes, OK?...
- alpha particles suddenly disappear when they get to nucleus center with E=3, p=11, n=118
- faking energy by changing clock dt is asking for trouble

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- SliderControl text entry is broken (in other sims too?)
- randomly place 79 electrons in PlumPuddingNode
- implement dynamic generation of nucleus view in RutherfordAtomNode
- don't create any alpha particles until done dragging sliders
- make ModelViewTransform an instance, not a singleton, test for non 1:1 transforms
- performance issue with drawing alpha particles and traces on top of large plum pudding image
- hide energy value on slider
- control panels should observe model

LOW PRIORITY:
- Spanish translations
- file level javadoc
- package level javadoc

DEFER UNTIL AFTER INTERVIEWS:

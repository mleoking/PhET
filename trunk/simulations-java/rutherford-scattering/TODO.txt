"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- make PlumPuddingNode place 79 electrons
- add control panel to "Plum Pudding" panel
- flesh out "Rutherford Atom" panel
- modify Rutherford Scattering algorithm

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- performance issue with drawing alpha particles on top of large plum pudding image (costly scaling xform?)

LOW PRIORITY:

DEFER UNTIL AFTER INTERVIEWS:

DONE:
3/2/07 - make plum pudding image larger, so that it fills the big box
3/2/07 - fix coordinate system mapping problems with zoom indicator
3/2/07 - make box of hydrogen shorter and gold
3/2/07 - check into new SVN project
3/2/07 - get everything to build without errors
3/1/07 - flesh out "Plum Pudding" panel
3/1/07 - cannibalize and simplify code from hydrogen-atom sim
3/1/07 - hook up basic services

PhetGraphic - Chris
    setLocation( Point)
    setLocation( int x, int y );
    getLocation()
    getBounds()
    setSize()
    getWidth()
    getHeight()
    getX()
    getY()
    deprecate setPosition()
    deprecate push/popRenderingHints()

CompositeGraphic
    rename

CompositePhetGraphic  - Ron & Sam
x    setLocation() should affect everything
x    same of similar methods
    redraw minimum number of pixels

x    children know absolute locations
x    children are added at absolute coordinates

x    PhetGraphic has reference to CompositePhetGraphic in which it is contained, if it is.
x        Manages visibility
x        May be used to manage relative/absolute location.

Events/Listeners - entire cast
    Use AWT2 event model going forward
    retrofit as needed

DefaultInteractiveGraphic
    make it a PhetGraphic

CompositePhetGraphic
    needs to implement InteractiveGraphic

PhetShapeGraphic - Chris
    change names to setStrokeColor() setFillColor()

PhetImageGraphic - Ron
    setLocation() sets a position independent of the transform.
    determineBounds() should return null if image hasn't been set.

Misc - Ron
    check paint() of PhetGraphic subclasses
    rewrite GraphicsState to check what things need to be restored in restoreState();
        also, handle paintMode & XORMode

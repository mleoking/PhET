Bug: Babinet's principle is not satisfied by this simulation.

o Schrodinger particles are ignoring the slits, when dt=1.0 in Richardson (1.01 and 0.99 are fine)

done:
•	Label the min and max of the velocity sliders for each type of particle so that students can easily see what the velocity range is and that it’s different for each particle.  The ranges should be:
o	Electrons: 920 km/s to 1840 km/s
o	Neutrons: 0.5 km/s to 1.0 km/s
o	Helium Atoms: 0.125 km/s to 0.250 km/s

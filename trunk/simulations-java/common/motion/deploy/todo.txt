support in ControlGraph for series pair and units changing

When resizing a graph, the layout can change (due to difference in axis labels), so realignment should be done after any data area changes.

Performance optimization.
    -Should cursors nodes use paint-immediately instead of creating a large repaint rectangle?  Or a different implementation for RepaintManager?
    -Repaint rectangles are large during normal operation, due to moving arrows (could be in separate repaint region?)

Bug: Timers for model & recording structures got out of sync.

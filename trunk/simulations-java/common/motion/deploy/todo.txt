Time derivatives need a time-offset to match other series.

When the time series is off-scale, dragging the slider doesn't immediately respond.
    -Clicking on the slider thumb should set the current value, and allow immediate drags.

When resizing a graph, the layout can change (due to difference in axis labels), so realignment should be done after any data area changes.

Performance optimization.
    -Should cursors nodes use paint-immediately instead of creating a large repaint rectangle?  Or a different implementation for RepaintManager?
    -Repaint rectangles are large during normal operation, due to moving arrows (could be in separate repaint region?)

Maybe Views of recorded data should observe a Recorded Data Model from time series package.

Bug: Timers for model & recording structures got out of sync.

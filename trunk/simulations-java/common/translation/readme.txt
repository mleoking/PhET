Should the Translation application be a project in common or build-tools?

Should the Translation application be implemented as a Java Web Start application?
    -To access filesystem and launch 'java.exe' process, a web start application should be signed.

Should all simulations be downloaded before a translation launch, or lazily download requested simulations?

Should we try to fit simulations into the same 'java.exe' process as the translation program, or use java.exe to launch?

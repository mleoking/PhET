This package contains a standard control for manipulating model (double) values.
The control combines a slider and textfield into one compound control, 
with a standardized layout.  See AbstractValueControl and its subclasses.
<p>
If you don't like the layout of AbstractValueControl, you can use the
AbstractSlider subclasses to create your own compound control.
<p>
The sliders use a Strategy pattern to map between JSlider (integer)
values and model (double) values.  Subclass AbstractMappingStrategy
to create your own mapping strategies.

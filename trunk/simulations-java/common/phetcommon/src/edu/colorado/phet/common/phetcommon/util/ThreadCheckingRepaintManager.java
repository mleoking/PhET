/**
 * ThreadCheckingRepaintManager provides an easy way to determine
 * if you are modifying Swing components on non-Swing threads.
 * Install this repaint manager like this:
 * <code>
 * RepaintManager.setCurrentManager( new ThreadCheckingRepaintManager() );
 * </code>
 * <p/>
 * This code was taken from an article at:
 * http://www.clientjava.com/blog/2004/08/20/1093059428000.html
 * <p/>
 * Sun's rule for Swing threading was:
 * Once a Swing component has been realized, all code that might
 * affect or depend on the state of that component should be executed
 * in the event-dispatching thread.
 * <p/>
 * Sun's has ammended this in The Java Tutorial as follows:
 * "We used to say that you could create the GUI on the main thread
 * as long as you didn't modify components that had already been realized.
 * Realized means that the component has been painted onscreen, or is ready
 * to be painted. The methods setVisible(true) and pack cause a window to
 * be realized, which in turn causes the components it contains to be realized.
 * While this worked for most applications, in certain situations it could
 * cause problems. Out of all the demos in the Swing Tutorial, we encountered
 * a problem only in ComponentEventDemo. In that case, sometimes when you
 * launched the demo, it would not come up because it would deadlock when
 * updating the text area if the text area had not yet been realized, while
 * other times it would come up without incident. To avoid the possibility
 * of thread problems, we recommend that you use invokeLater to create the
 * GUI on the event-dispatching thread for all new applications. If you
 * have old programs that are working fine they are probably OK; however
 * you might want to convert them when it's convenient to do so."

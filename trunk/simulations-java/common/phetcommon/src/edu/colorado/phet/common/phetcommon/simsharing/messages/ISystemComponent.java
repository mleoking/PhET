 * Marker interface for identifying objects that can be acted on by the system.
 * The marker interface makes it easy for us to make sure that we don't have typos in string copies, and use auto-complete for development.
 * <p/>
 * Extend IUserComponent here since the system sometimes acts on user items, like automatically closing a dialog

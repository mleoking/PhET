/**
 * ProbabilisticChooser
 * <p/>
 * An object that selects from a collection of objects based on probabilities.
 * <p/>
 * The object is constructed with an array of ProbabilisticChooser.Entry objects, each
 * of which contains a reference to an arbitrary object and the likelihood that it should
 * be chosen. The likelihoods can be expressed as any sort of number. The chooser
 * normalizes the likelihoods. The likelihoods could, for example, be expressed as the
 * count of a particular object in a population.
 * <p/>
 * When the chooser is asked to get() an object, an object from the collection of
 * entries will be returned with the likelihood expressed in its particular entry.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *
 *      public static void main( String[] args ) {
 *
 *           class TestClass {
 *               public String toString() {
 *                   return getClass().getName();
 *               }
 *           }
 *           class Cat extends TestClass{};
 *           class Dog extends TestClass{};
 *           class Hamster extends TestClass{};
 *
 *           // A chooser based on floating point probabilities
 *           ProbabilisticChooser.Entry[] entriesA = new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry[]{
 *                   new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry( new Cat(), .3 ),
 *                   new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry( new Dog(), .5 ),
 *                   new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry( new Hamster(), .2 )
 *           };
 *
 *           ProbabilisticChooser pcA = new ProbabilisticChooser( entriesA );
 *           for( int i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
 *               System.out.println( "pcA.get() = " + pcA.get() );
 *           }
 *
 *           // A chooser based on numbers of elements in a population
 *           ProbabilisticChooser.Entry[] entriesB = new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry[]{
 *                   new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry( new Cat(), 6 ),
 *                   new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry( new Dog(), 4 ),
 *                   new ProbabilisticChooser.Entry( new Hamster(), 3 )
 *           };
 *
 *           ProbabilisticChooser pcB = new ProbabilisticChooser( entries );
 *           for( int i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
 *               System.out.println( "pcB.get() = " + pcB.get() );

<body>This package provides a mechanism for accessing JNLP-like services while running outside of java web start (e.g.
opening a browser, file save/load)

The purpose of this project is to make it easy for phet applications to have save/load, open web browsers, etc
and for it to work whether the application is webstarted or local.

In JNLP, these functions are called services, and they are managed by a single class called the ServiceManager.

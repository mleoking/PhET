"To Do" list for phetcommon
===============================================================================

- (Unfuddle #90)
Module.setActiveModule has ordering dependencies and doesn't seem to work as expected.
After adding modules to a PhetApplication, the first module added will be the 
active module when the sim starts. I would expect that calling setActiveModule
would allow me to activate a different module at startup (useful mainly during 
development), but that doesn't happen if setActiveModule is called before startApplication;
there is order dependency here, and startApplication always activates the first module added.
If I override startApplication like this:
    public void startApplication() {
        super.startApplication();
        setActiveModule( someModule );
    }
...then someModule is indeed active when the sim starts, but it's PCanvas
is displayed in a strange state before it's then repainted properly.

- (Unfuddle #91) Help items don't refresh fast enough. Very obvious when help item is attached
to a moving node (as in optical-tweezers).  The cause of this may be the same
as the "AWT redraw priority" issue mentioned below.

9/6/2007
Add exceptions for missing resources (not easy; currently all sims depend on
missing version information resources for common components).

8/31/2007 (reid)
Move get/set requested DT into parent level for clocks?  Does this make sense for all clock implementations?

8/7/07 (cmalley) :
update all sims to use PhetDefaultFont instead of hardcoding specific physical
or logical font names (eg "Lucida Sans")

- (Unfuddle #89) Consider using PhetFrameWorkaround to address AWT redraw priority problem on slower machines.
Most obvious manifestation is that dialogs don't repaint when first opened while clock is running.
This is noticeable with all sims that I've tried with Java 1.5.
This was not an issue with Java 1.4.

- (Unfuddle #88) Deferred initialization of modules. All modules are currently instantiated and initialzed
when creating a PhetApplication. If there are several modules, each with some involved
initialization, it can take quite awhile for the simulation to come up. This is undesirable,
especilly if the user has no intention of visiting the more advanced panels.

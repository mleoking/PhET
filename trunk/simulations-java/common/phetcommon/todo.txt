"To Do" list for phetcommon
===============================================================================

6/4/07 (cmalley) :
Consider using PhetFrameWorkaround to address AWT redraw priority problem on slower machines. 
This is noticeable with all sims that I've tried with Java 1.5.  
This was not an issue with Java 1.4.

6/4/07 (cmalley) :
Deferred initialization of modules. All modules are currently instantiated and initialzed
when creating a PhetApplication. If there are several modules, each with some involved 
initialization, it can take quite awhile for the simulation to come up. This is undesirable,
especilly if the user has no intention of visiting the more advanced panels.

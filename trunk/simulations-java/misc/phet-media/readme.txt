This program is a multimedia browser for phet applications.  It can be used to download all simulations (using the SimLauncher), then to search for media files in the jar files.

It creates a phet-mm-temp directory in the directory from which the application is run for storage of the media files.

It also creates a phet-mm.properties for user properties.

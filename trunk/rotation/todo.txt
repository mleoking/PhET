Color coding for variables.

Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data

Time derivatives need a time-offset to match other series.
  
Should TimeSeriesModel be extended or listened to for Rotation-specific behaivor?

Test at 1024x768

On rotational motion sim, lots of it worked well and looked good, but when showing acceleration a, the zero and the curve was below bottom of graph sometime.  Angular acceleration  worked well though.

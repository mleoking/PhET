Color coding for variables.

Time derivatives need a time-offset to match other series.
  
Should TimeSeriesModel be extended or listened to for Rotation-specific behaivor?

Test at 1024x768

On rotational motion sim, lots of it worked well and looked good, but when showing acceleration a, the zero and the curve was below bottom of graph sometime.  Angular acceleration  worked well though.

Performance optimization.

Time series implementation.

Graphs shouldn't fill entire vertical space when there is only 1.

When the time series is off-scale, dragging the slider doesn't immediately respond.

Add a graph cursor.

Time series are offset incorrectly in graphs (their x-offset is before the beginning of the graph).

Try 2nd order derivative directly from position data..?

o perceived color doesn't go to black when filter blocks all photons
(DONE) o pre-fitler beam sometimes not visible
(DONE) o photons slow way down when switching filter on

o background color on Windows
o Help, based on Kathy's requirements

MEDIUM:

(DONE) o optimize all image files for Web

LOW:
o font antialiasing on Windows (and Linux?)

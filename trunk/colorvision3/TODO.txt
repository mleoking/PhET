"To Do" list for "colorvision3" project

HIGH:
RBG Bulbs module:
(DONE) 1. Add a "wiggle me" that disappears as soon as one of the sliders is moved.
          Position this wiggle-me so that it is pointing at the knob of the top (red) slider.

Single Bulb module:
(DONE) 2. When the bulb is white, reduce the number of photons passed by the filter
    to half of the number currently passed.
3. Standardize behavior of the sliders. When the user changes his/her drag direction,
    do not move the slider knob until the cursor is over the knob.
4. Use a non-gray color for the simulation's background, ala other PhET simulations.
(DONE) 5. Rename "Beam Type" to "Beam View" in the control panel.
(DONE) 6. Add more space between the control groups in the control panel.
(DONE) 7. Use a larger font for the title of each control group in the control panel.
(DONE) 8. Move the Filter on/off control out of the control panel and into the apparatus panel.
          Locate it directly below the filter holder. Make it clear to the user how to select
          "on" and "off" states for the filter.
(DONE) 9. When the filter is "off", hide only the filter.  The Filter Color slider and filter stand
          should remain visible.
(DONE) 9a. Intialize to show photon beam and yellow filter.

Global issues:
10. Work with Kathy on Help, defer MegaHelp.
(DONE) 11. Pause when the simulation is minimized.

MEDIUM:
(DONE) o investigate fixed clock
(DONE) o Match intensity slider value to background gradient color
o test IntensitySlider in Horizontal orientation
o support orientation of SpectrumSlider
o support scaling of SpectrumSlider
o move "inUse" and "filtered" flags out of Photon model; manage separate lists in PhotonBeam model

LOW:
o parent -> component throughout
o switch to PhET code formatting conventions
o Help

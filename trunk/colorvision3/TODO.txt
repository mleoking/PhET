"To Do" list for "colorvision3" project

HIGH:
o cull filtered photons and make them fully opaque
o make use of intensity component of ColorChangeEvent when source is photon beam
o reduce CPU usage (lots of repaints when photon beam is enabled)
o why is filter notch curve not anti-aliased when photon beam is enabled?
o filter notch curve is not drawn correctly, Y scale is off
o spectrum graphic bounds get changed when I render the SpectrumSlider bounds

MEDIUM:
o try using ApparatusPanel2 for application scaling
o move "enabled" and "filtered" flags out of Photon model; manage separate lists in PhotonBeam model

LOW:
o switch to PhET code formatting conventions
o Help

ENHANCEMENTS:
o put bulb color & filter color on a single spectrum slider so it's easier to see how they compare

"To Do" list for "colorvision3" project

HIGH:
o make photon beam interact with filter
o make photon beam send an event when perceived color or intensity changes (currently only intensity)

MEDIUM:
o split filter graphic into foreground/background so photons appear to go thru filter
o make pre-filter solid beam slightly transparent, clip post-filter beam
o show filter transmission width on filter spectrum slider

LOW:
o use Point for specifying locations that are based on int
o add a UI control for filter transmission width (in nm)

IDEAS:
o put bulb color & filter color on a single spectrum slider so it's easier to see how they compare

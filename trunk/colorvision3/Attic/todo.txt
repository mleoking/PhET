"To Do" list for "colorvision3" project

HIGH:
o bulb control slider doesn't fully draw when monochromatic is first chosen for bulb type
o filter color slider isn't fully erased when filter is disabled
o cull filtered photons and make them fully opaque
o make use of intensity component of ColorChangeEvent when source is photon beam
o reduce CPU usage (lots of repaints when photon beam is enabled)
o why is filter notch curve not anti-aliased when photon beam is enabled?

MEDIUM:
o try using ApparatusPanel2 for application scaling

LOW:
o Help

ENHANCEMENTS:
o put bulb color & filter color on a single spectrum slider so it's easier to see how they compare

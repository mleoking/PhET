This is a summary of known and reported problems for the Color Vision simulation.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

o Photons exiting the filter should be culled based on the percentage of the
  spotlight color passed by the filter.  The photons should retain their color,
  but have their intensity reduced by the percentage of the spotlight color passed
  by the filter.
  
o Filter transmission width shown on Filter Color slider is not rendered correctly.

o Reported performance problem in RGB Bulb module when using Red or Blue spotlights.
  Photon beam very slow, then speeds up after switching to other module and back.

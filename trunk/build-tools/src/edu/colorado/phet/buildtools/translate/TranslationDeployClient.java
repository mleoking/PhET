/**
 * This is the 3-27-2009 rewrite of translation deploying.
 * Here's the basic technique:
 * 1. Client identifies new localization files to integrate, by putting them in a directory and telling the program which directory.
 * 2. Client uploads localization files to a new, unique folder on tigercat
 * 3. Client runs server side integration program, passing
 *          the path to "jar" utility
 *          the path to build-local.properties (for signing)
 *          the directory containing new localization files
 * 4. Client opens a browser in the unique directory
 * 5. User is instructed to wait for a "finished.txt" file to appear; this signifies that server side code is finished.
 * 4. For each project in the unique-dir, the server
 *      a. Copies the project_all.jar to the unique directory
 *      b. Runs java -jar to integrate the new translations into the project_all.jar
 *      c. Signs the modified project_all.jar
 *      d. creates new JNLP Files (note, these can't be tested unless codebase is correct.)
 * 5. Notifies completion with a file finished.txt or creates an error log error.txt
 * 6. User tests the new project_all.jar files and/or JNLP files
 * 7. User signifies to server that sims can be copied to the sim directory.

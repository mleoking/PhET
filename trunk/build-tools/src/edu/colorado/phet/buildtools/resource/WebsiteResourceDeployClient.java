/**
 * TODO: update docs for new version (may be out of date)
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: be wary of the following code. sim and project was used interchangeably!
 * <p/>
 * This class is used to log into a website, create the necessary temporary directory structure, and upload the necessary
 * files.
 * <p/>
 * The directory structure on the typical website is shown below:
 * <p/>
 * htdocs/sims/resources/
 * (temporary resource directory)/ -- Holds everything related to this particular deployment. ex: 1242706828232_common-strings-ar-xml
 * The first part includes the timestamp of approximately when the directory was created
 * resource/
 * resource.properties     -- Holds properties (to be described below) of what JARs to poke, generate, the resource name, etc.
 * (resource file)         -- The file that will be poked into JARs. Name specified in resource.properties
 * <p/>
 * test/                       -- Directory that holds all of the files necessary to test the new deployment.
 * (sim dirs)/
 * <p/>
 * backup/                     -- Directory that holds all files that will be changed
 * (sim dirs)/
 * <p/>
 * extras/                     -- (optional) Directory that holds additional files to be added and backed up
 * (sim dirs)/
 * <p/>
 * resource.properties properties:
 * resourceFile (the name of the file contained in the resource subdirectory)
 * resourceDestination (string path of where to put the file in JARs. should end with a slash)
 * sims (comma-separated list of sims to add the resource into)
 * mode (either 'java' or 'flash')
 * <p/>
 * WebsiteResourceDeployClient is used to first upload resource.properties and the resource file.
 * Then optionally extra files (in extras) can be added. Extras were created to handle the Flash HTMLs that need to be regenerated
 * for a common translation.
 * <p/>
 * WebsiteResourceDeployServer, when activated, follows the following steps:
 * (1) loads resource.properties (contains list of sims), locates the resource file, and creates the backup directory
 * (2) copies all JARs for each sim from their live directory into their subdirectory in the backup directory
 * ex: copies htdocs/sims/pendulum-lab/pendulum-lab_en.jar to
 * htdocs/sims/resources/1242706828232_common-strings-ar-xml/backup/pendulum-lab/pendulum-lab_en.jar
 * (3) copies JARs (if java mode, only the JARs ending in _all.jar) into the test directory
 * ex: copies to htdocs/sims/resources/1242706828232_common-strings-ar-xml/test/pendulum-lab/pendulum-lab_en.jar
 * (4) pokes the resource file into all JARs in the test directories
 * (5) resigns all of those JARs
 * (6) if java mode, generates the offline JARs with JARGenerator (in the test directories); JARGenerator signs these jars when they are made
 * (7) if files exist in the extras directories, their counterparts in the live dir are backed up
 * ex: htdocs/sims/pendulum-lab/pendulum-lab_ar.html backed up to
 * htdocs/sims/resources/1242706828232_common-strings-ar-xml/backup/pendulum-lab/pendulum-lab_ar.html
 * (8) the extras files are copied into the test directories.
 * (9) if flash mode, SWFs are copied from their live directories into both the test and backup directories
 * NOTE: during publishing, the SWFs in the live directory will not be replaced.
 * <p/>
 * WebsiteResourceDeployPublisher, when activated, follows the following steps:
 * (1) If an exception occurs in any of the following steps, it will immediately stop and print instructions to revert
 * (2) Each non-SWF file in the test directories is copied into the corresponding live sim directories (most likely replacing
 * what was there)
 * <p/>
 * WebsiteResourceDeployReverter, when activated, follows the following steps:
 * (1) For each non-SWF file in the test directory that also exists in the backup directory, the backup file is copied into the live sim directory

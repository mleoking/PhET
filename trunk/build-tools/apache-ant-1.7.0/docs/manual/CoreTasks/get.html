<h2><a name="get">Get</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Gets a file from a URL. When the verbose option is &quot;on&quot;, this task
displays a '.' for every 100 Kb retrieved. Any URL schema supported by
the runtime is valid here, including http:, ftp: and jar:; 
https: is only valid if the appropriate support is added to the pre-1.4 Java
runtimes. 
 
</p>
The <i>usetimestamp</i> option enables you to control downloads so that the remote file is
only fetched if newer than the local copy. If there is no local copy, the download always takes 
place. When a file is downloaded, the timestamp of the downloaded file is set to the remote timestamp,
if  the JVM is Java1.2 or later. 
NB: This timestamp facility only works on downloads using the HTTP protocol. 
<p>
A username and password can be specified, in which case basic 'slightly encoded
plain text' authentication is used. This is only secure over an HTTPS link.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proxies</b>. Since Ant1.7, Ant running on Java1.5 or later defaults to 
    <a href="../proxy.html">using
    the proxy settings of the operating system</a>. There is also the  
 <a href="../OptionalTasks/setproxy.html">&lt;setproxy&gt;</a> task for
    earlier Java versions. With proxies turned on, <code>&lt;get&gt;</code> requests against
    localhost may not work as expected, if the request is relayed to the proxy.
    The <code>-noproxy</code> option can be used to turn this feature off.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>  &lt;get src=&quot;http://ant.apache.org/&quot; dest=&quot;help/index.html&quot;/&gt;</pre>
<p>Gets the index page of http://ant.apache.org/, and stores it in the file <code>help/index.html</code>.</p>

<pre>  &lt;get src=&quot;http://www.apache.org/dist/ant/KEYS&quot; 
    dest=&quot;KEYS&quot; 
    verbose=&quot;true&quot;
    usetimestamp=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</pre>
<p>
Gets the PGP keys of Ant's (current and past) release managers, if the local copy
is missing or out of date. Uses the verbose option 
for progress information.
</p>

<pre>  &lt;get src=&quot;https://insecure-bank.org/statement/user=1214&quot; 
    dest=&quot;statement.html&quot; 
    username="1214";
    password="secret"/&gt;</pre>
<p>
Fetches some file from a server with access control. Because https is being used the
fact that basic auth sends passwords in plaintext is moot.

  <p align="left">This is the manual for version 1.7.0 of 
  <a target="_top" href="http://ant.apache.org/index.html">Apache Ant</a>. 
    If your version 
    of Ant (as verified with <tt>ant -version</tt>) is older or newer than this 
    version then this is not the correct manual set. Please use the documentation 
    appropriate to your current version. Also, if you are using a version
    older than the most recent release, we recommend an upgrade to fix bugs
    as well as provide new functionality. </p>

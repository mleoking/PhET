Needs:

  IDE:
    navigation
    refactoring (move, rename,...)
    presentation compiler support

  Software engineering:
    assert
    logger
    arg validation (type, required vs optional, value)
    adhoc (test mains) and unit tests

  Easel:
    DisplayObject bounds
    lack of support for dirty regions?

  Sim framework:
    Game loop?
    something similar to Property<T> (Object.observe in ECMAScript.next)


Annoyances, productivity drains:

    Having to manually enter each "import" for requirejs.

    Browser error messages involving requirejs are terrible.

    Renaming or moving something is painful, and the pain will scale with project size.

    Can't navigate to things. If you're lucky, it requires multiple steps, including a manual association of requirejs import to function param.

    IntelliJ "find file" doesn't offer files in the JS project that you're working on as first choices (like it does for Java)


Typical errors:

    TypeError: this.initialize is not a function : occurs in easel.js when you forget:
    - 'this', eg in Number.call(this) or this.myfunction
    - 'new'
    - a requirejs function param

    TypeError: Foo is undefined
    - you probably forgot to 'return Foo' from your requirejs define function

TODO list for faraday

HIGH:
- add a "finger" indicator on tablets
- resolve requirejs include problem
- improve tablet performance

MEDIUM:
- startup error: Empty string passed to getElementById().
- investigate non-modal popups
- investigate other patterns for Options panel

LOW:
- center title at top of Options panel (see css)
- compass/magnet collision detection (bounds computations)
- "not well-formed" errors for optionsButton.html template
- cache needles at various angles (and alphas?) to improve performance
- use css instead of <br> to add vertical space

Questions:
- what order do scripts need to be loaded? why are jq and jqm special?
- data-dismissible="false" for popups - to be added in jqm 1.3
- do <input> and <button> need to have 'name' attributes?
- how does one find out what function to call for refreshing jqm?

General:
- data collection (SR's Analytics.js)
- detecting mobile devices
- Easel bounds

Needs:

IntelliJ codestyle

assert

logger

arg validation (type, required vs optional, value)

documentation tools/conventions (eg, how to doc function param types)

test mains and unit tests

something similar to Property<T>

DisplayObject bounds

DisplayObject alpha modulation




Patterns:

Combination inheritance

private fields and methods


Observations:

Having to manually enter each "import" for requirejs.

Browser error messages involving requirejs are terrible.

Renaming or moving something is painful, and the pain will scale with project size.

Can't navigate to things. If you're lucky, it requires multiple steps, including a manual association of requirejs import to function param.

IntelliJ "find file" doesn't off files in the JS project that you're working on as first choices (like it does for Java)

Typical errors:

TypeError: this.initialize is not a function : occurs in easel.js when you forget:
    - 'this', eg in Number.call(this) or this.myfunction
    - 'new'
    - a requirejs function param

Need:

IntelliJ codestyle

assert

arg validation (type, required vs optional, value)

something similar to Property<T>

DisplayObject bounds

test mains and unit tests


Observations:

Having to manually enter each "import" for requirejs.

Browser error messages involving requirejs are terrible.

If you rename something, you have to manually track down usages and fix.

Can't navigate to things. If you're lucky, it requires multiple steps, including a manual association of requirejs import to function param.

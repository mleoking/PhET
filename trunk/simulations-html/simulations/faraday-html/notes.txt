Need:

IntelliJ codestyle

assert

arg validation (type, required vs optional, value)

something similar to Property<T>

DisplayObject bounds

test mains and unit tests

how to doc function param types? {Type}?

DisplayObject alpha modulation


Observations:

Having to manually enter each "import" for requirejs.

Browser error messages involving requirejs are terrible.

Renaming or moving something is painful, and the pain will scale with project size.

Can't navigate to things. If you're lucky, it requires multiple steps, including a manual association of requirejs import to function param.

IntelliJ "find file" doesn't off files in the JS project that you're working on as first choices (like it does for Java)

Typical errors:

TypeError: this.initialize is not a function : occurs in easel.js when you forget:
    - 'this', eg in Number.call(this) or this.myfunction
    - 'new'
    - a requirejs function param

TODO list for faraday

Features:
- why are button icons missing when using contrib/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.css?
- strength slider doesn't reset (assigning to slider.value doesn't move the handle)
- check boxes are not rendering correctly (disabling loading of app scripts fixed this, so it's likely a load issue)
- #optionsPanel resize in ControlPanel constructor doesn't seem to be happening
- can close-by-clicking-outside be disabled for popups?
- fix layout of options panel header
- overlap the "Options" button with the canvas
- hide the "Options" button when the options panel is popped up
- compass/magnet collision detection (bounds computations)
- move stuff to simulations-html/common
- dipole model for bar magnet

Questions:
- what order do scripts need to be loaded? why are jquery and jquery.mobile special?
- do I need to put jquery and jquery.mobile paths in faraday-config.js when they're loaded in faraday.html?
- do I need to define(['jquery'],function($){...}) ?

General:
- widgets (jquery-mobile)
- handle window resize (see ESP:tab.onResize or concentration:main.onResize)
- data collection (SR's Analytics.js)
- mobile devices
- test with all browsers
- Easel bounds

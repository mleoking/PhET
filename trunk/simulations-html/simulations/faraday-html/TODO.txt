TODO list for faraday

HIGH:
- handle window resize (see ESP:tab.onResize or concentration:main.onResize), scale vs world-bounds

MEDIUM:
- investigate non-modal popups
- investigate other patterns for Options panel
- hide the "Options" button when pressed, show when popup is dismissed

LOW:
- center title at top of Options panel (see css)
- compass/magnet collision detection (bounds computations)
- move stuff to simulations-html/common
- "not well-formed" errors for optionsButton.html template
- cache needles at various angles (and alphas?) to improve performance
- use css instead of <br> to add vertical space

Questions:
- what order do scripts need to be loaded? why are jq and jqm special?
- can close-by-clicking-outside be disabled for popups? (data-dismissible="false" doesn't seem to work)
- do <input> and <button> need to have 'name' attributes?
- how does one find out what function to call for refreshing jqm?

General:
- data collection (SR's Analytics.js)
- detecting mobile devices
- Easel bounds

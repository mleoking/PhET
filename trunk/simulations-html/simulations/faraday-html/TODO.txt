TODO list for faraday

HIGH:
- slider is not being rewritten by jqm
- address error caused by setting initial slider value (see last line of WidgetConnector.connectSliderToProperty)
- jqm options panel rewrites the URL, conflicts with i18n
- fix layout of options panel header

MEDIUM:
- remove css workaround for "#strengthSliderDiv .ui-slider-handle"
- hide the "Options" button when the options panel is popped up (how does the app know?)
- dipole model for bar magnet

LOW:
- compass/magnet collision detection (bounds computations)
- move stuff to simulations-html/common
- "not well-formed" errors for optionsButton.html template

Questions:
- what order do scripts need to be loaded? why are jquery and jquery.mobile special?
- can close-by-clicking-outside be disabled for popups?
- do <input> and <button> need to have 'name' attributes?
- how does one find out what function to call for refreshing jqm?

General:
- apache server config for testing
- handle window resize (see ESP:tab.onResize or concentration:main.onResize), scale vs world-bounds
- data collection (SR's Analytics.js)
- detecting mobile devices
- Easel bounds

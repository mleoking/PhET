TODO list for faraday

Features:
- slider is not working in template
- address error causes by setting initial slider value (see last line of WidgetConnector.connectSliderToProperty)
- jqm options panel rewrites the URL, conflicts with i18n
- #optionsPanel resize in ControlPanel constructor doesn't seem to be happening
- fix layout of options panel header
- overlap the "Options" button with the canvas (I'm doing this is css, but is it right?)
- hide the "Options" button when the options panel is popped up (how does the app know?)
- compass/magnet collision detection (bounds computations)
- move stuff to simulations-html/common
- dipole model for bar magnet
- use jquery css selectors for dom access
- remove css workaround for "#strengthSliderDiv .ui-slider-handle"

Questions:
- what order do scripts need to be loaded? why are jquery and jquery.mobile special?
- do I need to put jquery and jquery.mobile paths in faraday-config.js when they're loaded in faraday.html?
- do I need to define(['jquery'],function($){...}) ?
- can close-by-clicking-outside be disabled for popups?
- why am I getting "not well-formed" errors when using tpl substitutions?
- do <input> and <button> need to have 'name' attributes?
- how does one find out what function to call for refreshing jqm?

General:
- widgets (jquery-mobile)
- handle window resize (see ESP:tab.onResize or concentration:main.onResize), scale vs world-bounds
- data collection (SR's Analytics.js)
- apache server config for testing
- detecting mobile devices
- Easel bounds

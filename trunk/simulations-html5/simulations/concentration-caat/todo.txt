show a frame rate readout
respect size of target window
integrate with C:\Users\Sam\Desktop\CAAT\documentation\debug\debug_template.html, this will show frame rate
try webgl renderer?
center in target window

pinch to zoom on the frame
    tried setGestureEnabled() and it worked on the shaker but not the whole scene.

<h3><a name="xml"></a>1.1. About XML</h3>

<p>
    The extensible markup language, XML, is a way to mark up text in a structured document.
</p>

<p>
    XML is a simplification of the complex SGML standard. SGML, the Standard Generalized
    Markup Language, is an international (ISO) standard for marking up text
    and graphics. The best known application of SGML is HTML.
</p>

<p>
    Although SGML data is very easy to write, it's very difficult to write a generic
    SGML parser. When designing XML however, the authors removed much of the
    flexibility of SGML making it much easier to parse XML documents correctly.
</p>

<p>
    XML data is structured as a tree of entities. An entity can be a string of character
    data or an element which can contain other entities. Elements can optionally have a
    set of attributes. Attributes are key/value pairs which set some properties of an element.
    The following example shows some XML data:
</p>

<p class="example">
    &lt;book&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;chapter id="my chapter"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;The title&lt;/title&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some text.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/chapter&gt;<br>
    &lt;/book&gt;
</p>

<p>
    At the root of the tree, you can find the element "book". This element contains one
    child element: "chapter". The chapter element has one attribute which maps the key
    "id" to "my chapter". The chapter element has two child entities: the element "title"
    and the character data "Some text.". Finally, the title element has one child, the
    string "The title".
</p>

<h3><a name="nanoxml"></a>1.2. About NanoXML</h3>

<p>
    In April 2000, NanoXML was first released as a spin-off project of AUIT, the
    Abstract User Interface Toolkit.
</p>

<p>
    The intent of NanoXML was to be a small parser which was easy to use. SAX and
    DOM are much too complex for what I needed and the mainstream parsers were
    either much too big or had a very restrictive license.
</p>

<p>
    NanoXML 1 has all the features I needed: it is very small (about 6K), is reasonably
    fast for small XML documents, is very easy to use and is free (zlib/libpng license).
    As I never intended to use NanoXML to parse DocBook documents, there was no
    support for mixed data or DTD parsing.
</p>

<p>
    NanoXML was released as a SourceForge project and, because of the very good
    response from its users, it matured to a small and stable parser. The final version,
    release 1.6.8 was released in May 2001.
</p>

<p>
    Because of its small size, people started to use NanoXML for embedded systems
    (KVM, J2ME) and kindly submitted patches to make NanoXML work in such
    restricted environment.
</p>

<h3><a name="nanoxml2"></a>1.3. NanoXML 2</h3>

<p>
    In July 2001, NanoXML 2 has been released. Unlike NanoXML 1, speed and XML
    compliancy were considered to be very important when the new parser was
    designed. NanoXML 2 is also very modular: you can easily replace the different
    components in the parser to customize it to your needs. The modularity of
    NanoXML 2 also benefits extensions like e.g. SAX support which can now directly
    access the parser. In NanoXML 1, the SAX adapter had to iterate the data structure
    built by the base product.
</p>

<p>
    Although many features were added to NanoXML, the second release was still
    very small. The full parser with builder fits in a JAR file of about 32K. This is still
    very tiny, especially when you compare this with the "standard" parsers of more
    than four times its size.
</p>

<p>
    As there is still need for a tiny parser like NanoXML 1, there is a special branch of
    NanoXML 2: NanoXML/Lite. This parser is source compatible with NanoXML 1
    but features a new parsing algorithm which makes it more than twice as fast as the
    older version. It is however more restrictive on the XML data it parses: the older
    version allowed some not-wellformed data to be parsed.
</p>

<p>
    There are three branches of NanoXML 2:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>NanoXML/Lite is the successor of NanoXML 1. It features an almost compatible
        parser which is extremely small.
    <li>NanoXML/Java is the standard parser.
    <li>NanoXML/SAX is the SAX adapter for NanoXML/Java.
</ul>

<p>
    The latest version of NanoXML is NanoXML 2.2, which is released in January
    2001.

The screen updates automatically when paused:
    -when firing a particle
    -when changing visualization style
Add control panel buttons for stopwatch & ruler.
Put the gun type menu in a control box to the left of the gun.
Add a ruler and a clock.  When user changes from electrons to neutrons or helium atoms,
    put an animation of a clock whose hands are slowing down next to actual clock,
    with a bubble that pops up and says “slowing down time.”
    If you go back to electrons, time speeds up and an analogous animation appears.
Added save/load feature for saving barriers/detectors.

* New in 0.32 (1-5-2006)
Fixed the range of sliders for particles velocities to keep the physics in a meaningful range.
Added units to the simulation (initialization & richardson propagator).
Bugfix: initial wavepackets weren't using hbar
Removed the Custom atom (the one with settable mass)

* New in 0.30 (1-5-2006)
This version uses PSwing in the piccolo project.

* New in 0.29 (1-5-2006)
Corrected phase in Initial wavepackets.
Detectors are now disabled when inverse slits are on.
Moved the "Inverse Barrier" from "Advanced" to "Double Slits"
Renamed the "Inverse Barrier" checkbox to "Anti-slits".
The first detector appears in the center of the box just below the slits.
Added a "Remove All" button for detectors.
Bugfix: With lots of detectors in the single particle panel, I’ve seen it get into a mode where sometimes the wave function would suddenly disappear, but no dot would appear on the screen,and you have to hit the “clear wave button.” / In Single Particle, with a detector on each slit, sometimes both detectors fire simultaneously and the particle disappears.  Hard to reproduce this reliably.
    -Multiple detectors were trying to grab the wavefunction at a single time.
Fixed the range of sliders (for slits) to keep the physics in a meaningful range.
Bugfix: High Intensity mode erroneously displays % values in slit-detectors.

* New in 0.28 (1-4-2005)
Bugfix: resolution changes still crash every now and then.
Bugfix: I managed to get a barrier to jump to a new location and disintegrate, so that the red part of it was gone, and the x on the upper left corner and the green thing on the lower right corner switched places.
Bugfix: Resizing a detector beyond (0,0) has the wrong behavior.
Bugfix: If I add barriers, then add slits, then remove the slits, all the barriers shift out of their boxes.  If I move a barrier after this happens, it snaps back into its box.

* New in 0.26 (1-2-2005) Posted on the main site on 1-4-2006
Removed the 'one-shot' detection button
Bugfix: Sometimes in autofire, the bullets fire quickly from the gun, not having enough time to move more than a few steps across the lattice.
Attached the screen controls to the screen.
Made the top of the left gun narrower so it’s about the same size as the other gun.
Moved the double slit controls to the control panel
Got rid of double slits controls and all the advanced controls on 2-laser
Moved 'clear wave' to the control panel
Change the name of “slit absorption” to “absorbing barriers”
Renamed 'save' to 'copy screen'
When detectors are disabled, the border turns gray and readout disappears.
Removed 'enable all' button (for detectors).
Bugfix: resolution changes are not rescaled.
Bugfix: resolution changes still crash every now and then.

New in 0.25 (12-12-2005):
Increased the barrel size of second gun.

New in 0.24 (12-11-2005):
Added inverse slits feature.  (Babinet's principle is currently not satisfied by this simulation.)
Bugfix: In high intensity with intensity low (and had a detector) the light continued to emenate from the slits (but not the gun)
Slit absorption no longer fails when there is a detector over one of the slits.
Bugfix: the autorepeat on single photon jams with no photons leaving
Bugfix: Detection events no longer fade.
Added absorption & detectors on high-intensity mode
Bugfix: Slit absorption is incompatible with detectors south of the midline.
Change the name of the options menu from "Schrodinger" to "Options".
Bugfix: detectors & barriers only work north of the slits, or if slit absorption is disabled.

New in 0.23 (12-10-2005):
Fixed the dis-play of the two lasers panel so that the controls don't cover 
the lasers.
Fixed the display of two lasers panel so the light actually comes from the lasers.
Set electron mass to 1.0 (unitless, compare to 2.0 and 2.25 for Neutron and Helium).
Made autodetect the default for detectors.
bugfix: detectors become disabled after a successful detection.
Moved barriers & detectors to Advanced panels in control panel.
Increased the size of the Double Slit checkbox, to improve visibility.

New in 0.22 (12-4-2005):
Added neutrons to “gun type” list, change “atoms” to “He atoms”, added custom atoms.
Moved Double-Slit checkbox into the play area, and off the control panel.
The “slit absorption” checkbox, the slit control sliders, and the detector controls, are all be invisible if the double slit is unchecked.
Wave area size is computed based on all controls (to ensure everything fits).
“One-shot” is now one-shot per particle.  Once the particle is detected at the screen, the detector is automatically enabled again.
The “slit absorption” checkbox has been moved to the double slit control area.
Fixed Bug: sometimes when I press “remove all” button, barriers becomes translucent but don’t go away.
Barriers & Detectors appear at random locations (rather than all on top of each other at the same place).
Default slits are wider, so in the default setup, lots more wave reaches the detector.
Fixed Bug: the combo box was mistakenly shown in the Mandel panel.
In two lasers, there are two guns, one the same as in the previous panels, one different.
For electrons and atoms, gun is higher so that particles appear to come from inside the gun, not above it.
When “one-shot” is unchecked, all the disabled detectors are automatically enabled.
One-Shot detection is now disable by default.
Removed the swoop-style wiggle me.
Gray component backgrounds are now light green.
	<Change background color from gray to something more fun (blue background is better, but there’s still too much gray).>
bugfix: ·Application crashes on startup when different region is specified (due to “0,00” parse error.)
The default screen display on high intensity mode is “Average Intensity” not “hits.”
Put “Double slit” checkbox on control panel.
Double slit controls appear near slit if it is enabled.
Bugfix: Double slit detectors should be hidden when barrier is hidden.
Changing slit width no longer changes separation between centers of slits.
Added a corner to barriers and detectors, changed the mouse to double-head arrow.
	<Instead of yellow box to change size of barrier or detector, a small diagonal arrow should appear in the corner, like the arrow that appears to resize things in windows.>

0.00.18 (7-19-2006)
Moved value readouts north for control panel sliders.
Added more choices for atom size.

0.00.17 (7-18-2006)
Removed one decimal place from separation readout in saved plot.
Constrained the control panel sliders to meaningful values.

0.00.16 (7-17-2006)
Made atom size more continuous (user sets integer diameter, not radius).
Updated the look and feel to match QWI.
Made the simulation a little smaller, as in QWI.
Made the description (about dialog) take up 3 lines instead of one.
Bugfix: Text in the control panel disappears because the sim is working too hard (workaround).
Made sliders snap-to-ticks.

0.00.15 (7-17-2006)
Made protractor read positive on both sides.
Removed values from y-axis on plot.
“Atom separation.”  Range should be from 0.4nm to 1.2nm, in increments of 0.1nm.  Default value should be 0.6nm  (note that at low resolution, 1 grid point = 0.1nm)
“Atom radius.”  Range should be from 0.05nm to 0.25nm, in increments of 0.05nm.  Default value should be 0.1nm.
When you save a snapshot on the graph, the legend is labeled with both the velocity and the spacing in real units.
Centered the protractor on the main atom.

0.00.14 (7-16-2006)
Got rid of “Gun Type” pull-down menu.
Changed “Gun Controls” label to “Electron Gun Controls”
Atoms have been replaced with graphics of spheres.
Reduced range for velocity slider to 700km/s - 1840km/s.
Removed all controls on control panel below “Radius.”
Changed the default value for “vertical position” to 0.35 units.
Removed “show expectation value” options from options menu.
Got rid of digits after decimal point on angle on protractor.
Moved atom graphics to background.
Changed protractor angle to read 0-180 on both sides.
Made angle indicator appear on graph when opened, if the protractor is out.
Removed units on y-axis of graph.
If you close the graph with the x, the checkbox becomes unchecked.
Removed the “zooming out” magnifying glass icon that appeared on startup.

0.00.13 (6-28-2006)
Increased the max particle velocity by a factor of 4.

New in 0.00.12 (6-11-2006)
Rebuild with latest QWI.

*New in 0.11 (2-21-2006)
Save Snapshot layers the data in the same graph.
Added a graph legend (shows what fraction of the default velocity you used).
Save Snapshot datasets cycle colors (if it hits a light color like yellow, just record another data point).
Edge-based intensity reader is used by default (not radial)

*New in 0.10 (2-20-2006)
Atoms are square by default.
Saved-Snapshot remains "in-front," rather than being hidden by the application.
Fixed edge intensity reader to center on head atom (rather than center of the screen).
Decreased memory requirements on startup.

*New in 0.08 (2-18-2006)
Center the protractor on the lead atom.
Added "save snapshot" feature to the Intensity Plot.
You can choose between Square/Circular atoms in the control panel.

*New in 0.07
Feasibility test for square atoms.

*New in 0.06 (2-6-2006)
Added single particle fire button.
Fixed y0=0 crash bug.

*New in 0.05 (2-6-2006)
Added indicator graphic for protractor angle on plot.
Improved protractor graphics.
Wave clears when parameters are changed.

*New in 0.04 (2-5-2006)
Added particle controls;

*New in 0.03 (2-5-2006)
Added a plot.
Set electrons as only gun type.
Removed screen graphic & unnecessary controls.

*New in 0.02 (2-5-2006)
Added a protractor.

*New in 0.01 (2-4-2006)
Added controls for lattice spacing
Added controls for atom radius
Started new project for Davisson-Germer

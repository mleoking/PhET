Bug: Mandel panel photons all have same wavelength (though different color)
The reason we didn't discover this before is that it's hard to see with "time-averaged intensity mode" on.
>>see MandelSchrodingerPanel::createAccessor() for debugging this.

Mandel Panel should have both visualization styles
>>(if not too much work).

Reset should reset wavelength, velocity,
>>This proves to be very difficult right now.  After refactoring, should be piece of cake.

Bug: In all panels, if you move the wavelength slider all the way to the left, funny little brown squares flash all over the wave:
     >>I Can't reproduce this.

In Two Lasers panel, the left gun controls go off the screen at 1024x768 resolution:
      >>This problem has minimal visual impact, doesn't interfere with functionality and wouldn't be easy to fix.  I will wait on solving this bug.

If I check and uncheck “slit absorption” with no slits and no barriers, it creates little glitches in the beam.
High Intensity electrons with absorption and one detector gave blank answer in north region
    (although intensity pattern appeared on screen). <can't reproduce this>
When I move the vertical position of the slits, the response is very jerky and discontinuous.  Can this be any smoother?
o Wave function norm is incorrect.  A detector that covers the entire box only registers 80-95%, rather than 100%.
    -this is partly due to the particle leaking outside the box
Allow user to move slit barrier up and down by clicking on it and dragging.
The “slit absorption” checkbox should have no effect if there are no slits or barriers.

o There is an abnormally bright region just beneath the slits in intensity mode with detector(s) on.

Ruler should revise size on resolution change or wave area size change.

Sizes should be relative:
Slits
Wave velocity (hard to do this with a local propagator)

Gun should shrink for small screen size (gun size is now incorrectly dependent on screen size).

Add separate control for box physical size (independent of lattice size)?

Center the Reset All and Clear Wave buttons.
    This is difficult, given the "all control panels should have the same width" constraint.

Add a close button for the stopwatch.

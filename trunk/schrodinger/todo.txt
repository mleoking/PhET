•	If you start in E-field view and turn off detector, 
view changes temporarily to time-averaged intensity in upper half of box.  
This effect also happens for electrons.
>>This is not a visualization problem, but related to the switch from the 2-lattice model to the single lattice model. 
>>I'm not sure how the values for the single lattice are being determined.

•	Changing the particle type often messes up the wave function display.  
If you change the wave function display for one type of particle and then 
switch to a different type of particle, the actual display is the same as for 
the particle you just switched from, but the radio button for the display 
corresponds to whatever was last selected for the new type of particle, 
so that the radio button and the actual display don’t match.

•	In “hits” mode, the dots appear on the screen in columns, 
so it appears that there are many very thin interference fringes:
 
•	The “one-shot” checkbox doesn’t work.  
If auto-detect is checked, the detector is always one-shot, regardless of whether one-shot is checked or not.  
If auto-detect is off, the detector always allows multiple detections, regardless of whether one-shot is checked or not.  
The detector should never allow multiple detections of a single particle if one-shot is checked, 
and should always allow multiple detections if one-shot is unchecked.

•	If you put a detector over each slit in the single particle panel and detect the 
particles manually, rather than using auto-detect, it doesn’t seem to be equally 
likely to detect the particle in either detector, even though the probabilities written in both 
detectors are the same.  It almost always detects the particle in the first detector that you put on the screen.  
At first I thought that the other detector wasn’t activated, but if you do it enough times, 
the other detector will occasionally detect it.

•	For certain values of screen brightness in the two lasers panel, 
if there are two lasers of different colors that are both at maximum intensity, 
the pattern on the screen is asymmetric (this caused considerable confusion for student, 
and was much more noticeable in the interview than it is in this screen shot):
 
•	If I resize the simulation to full screen at 1280x1024 resolution, a bit of text that says 
“Off” appears next to the left laser in the two lasers panel:

I just looked at QWI for the first time since its wiggle me was added.
Once Chris has written the standard wiggle me,
would it be easy for you to change the one in QWI?
I barely noticed it when I opened the sim.
If it were a font that is about twice as large, bold,
colored (red maybe) and without a bubble I think it’d be more prominent.
It should enter from the top of the screen and descend
down to the location that it sits in now.
If this is still a lot of work even after Chris writes the standard wiggle me,
then don’t worry about it.

Bug: Mandel panel photons all have same wavelength (though different color)
The reason we didn't discover this before is that it's hard to see with "time-averaged intensity mode" on.
Mandel Panel should have both visualization styles
>>This proves difficult with the current setup.  I estimate 2+ hours to add these features.  For right now, I've reverted to intensity-view only, and wavelength is changed with color.
>>see MandelSchrodingerPanel::createAccessor() for debugging this.

Reset should reset wavelength, velocity,
>>This proves to be very difficult right now (2+ hours?).  After refactoring, should be piece of cake.

Bug: In all panels, if you move the wavelength slider all the way to the left, funny little brown squares flash all over the wave:
     >>I Can't reproduce this.

In Two Lasers panel, the left gun controls go off the screen at 1024x768 resolution:
      >>This problem has minimal visual impact, doesn't interfere with functionality and wouldn't be easy to fix.  I will wait on solving this bug.

•	For massive particles in High Intensity panel, turning on detector changes display from phase color to magnitude.
>> I thought this was a design decision because phase doesn't have the usual influence when one or more detectors are present.
>>Question is in to the team.

Putting a detector on the slits, then setting 'view E-Field' causes no graphics to appear north of the barriers.
____________________________________
Lower Priority
If I check and uncheck “slit absorption” with no slits and no barriers, it creates little glitches in the beam.
High Intensity electrons with absorption and one detector gave blank answer in north region
    (although intensity pattern appeared on screen). <can't reproduce this>
When I move the vertical position of the slits, the response is very jerky and discontinuous.  Can this be any smoother?
o Wave function norm is incorrect.  A detector that covers the entire box only registers 80-95%, rather than 100%.
    -this is partly due to the particle leaking outside the box
Allow user to move slit barrier up and down by clicking on it and dragging.
The “slit absorption” checkbox should have no effect if there are no slits or barriers.

o There is an abnormally bright region just beneath the slits in intensity mode with detector(s) on.

Ruler should revise size on resolution change or wave area size change.

Sizes should be relative:
Slits
Wave velocity (hard to do this with a local propagator)

Gun should shrink for small screen size (gun size is now incorrectly dependent on screen size).

Add separate control for box physical size (independent of lattice size)?

Center the Reset All and Clear Wave buttons.
    This is difficult, given the "all control panels should have the same width" constraint.

Add a close button for the stopwatch.

Modelslider labels have a bug on mac.

•	In Java version 1.4.2_03, the slider leaves a little trail when you move it 
and has a green rectangle behind the tick marks (see below).  
This problem does not appear in Java version 1.5.0_04 or 1.5.0_06.
Very difficult ( interface not exposed, internal bug in Java?).

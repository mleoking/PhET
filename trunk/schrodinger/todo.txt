•	For certain values of screen brightness in the two lasers panel, 
if there are two lasers of different colors that are both at maximum intensity, 
the pattern on the screen is asymmetric (this caused considerable confusion for student, 
and was much more noticeable in the interview than it is in this screen shot).
>>This is from reflection on the boundary. In Wave Interference sim, 
I extend the lattice beyond the visible region;
here it could also be done, but very time consuming to implement, 
and would slow down the sim (scales with the size of the boundary).

Initial Wiggle me is hard to see:
If it were a font that is about twice as large, bold,
colored (red maybe) and without a bubble I think it’d be more prominent.
It should enter from the top of the screen and descend
down to the location that it sits in now.

Bug: Mandel panel photons all have same wavelength (though different color)
The reason we didn't discover this before is that it's hard to see with "time-averaged intensity mode" on.
Mandel Panel should have both visualization styles
>>This proves difficult with the current setup.  I estimate 2+ hours to add these features.  For right now, I've reverted to intensity-view only, and wavelength is changed with color.
>>see MandelSchrodingerPanel::createAccessor() for debugging this.

Reset should reset wavelength, velocity,
>>This proves to be very difficult right now (2+ hours?).  After refactoring, should be piece of cake.

In Two Lasers panel, the left gun controls go off the screen at 1024x768 resolution:
      >>This problem has minimal visual impact, doesn't interfere with functionality and wouldn't be easy to fix.  I will wait on solving this bug.

# Lower Priority

If I check and uncheck “slit absorption” with no slits and no barriers, it creates little glitches in the beam.
High Intensity electrons with absorption and one detector gave blank answer in north region
    (although intensity pattern appeared on screen). <can't reproduce this>
When I move the vertical position of the slits, the response is very jerky and discontinuous.  Can this be any smoother?
o Wave function norm is incorrect.  A detector that covers the entire box only registers 80-95%, rather than 100%.
    -this is partly due to the particle leaking outside the box
Allow user to move slit barrier up and down by clicking on it and dragging.
The “slit absorption” checkbox should have no effect if there are no slits or barriers.

o There is an abnormally bright region just beneath the slits in intensity mode with detector(s) on.

Ruler should revise size on resolution change or wave area size change.

Sizes should be relative:
Slits
Wave velocity (hard to do this with a local propagator)

Gun should shrink for small screen size (gun size is now incorrectly dependent on screen size).

Add separate control for box physical size (independent of lattice size)?

Center the Reset All and Clear Wave buttons.
    This is difficult, given the "all control panels should have the same width" constraint.

Add a close button for the stopwatch.

Modelslider labels have a bug on mac.

Bug: In all panels, if you move the wavelength slider all the way to the left, funny little brown squares flash all over the wave:
     >>I Can't reproduce this.
     
•	In Java version 1.4.2_03, the slider leaves a little trail when you move it 
and has a green rectangle behind the tick marks (see below).  
This problem does not appear in Java version 1.5.0_04 or 1.5.0_06.
Very difficult ( interface not exposed, internal bug in Java?).

Can you please post a version of davisson germer in which the max 
velocity is 4x the current max?

Add a message to notify overwriting files when saving..?  There is a confirm message, but it doesn't say anything about overwriting a file.

How about being able to move the detector around while the simulation is paused?  Its readout should update while dragging.
Barriers too.

•	Fix asymmetry problems outlined in email.
I've figured out what the problem is with the asymmetry in the Two Lasers panel in QWI: the center of the left laser is 14 pixels from the left edge of the box and the center of the right laser is only 13 pixels from the edge of the box.  My guess is that you're measuring the distance from the center of the box, but it's rounding in some weird way because there are an odd numbers of pixels (45) in the box.  Can you fix this?
>>This problem may be alleviated due to the inexact wavelengths that will be most frequent now.
•	For certain values of screen brightness in the two lasers panel, 
if there are two lasers of different colors that are both at maximum intensity, 
the pattern on the screen is asymmetric (this caused considerable confusion for student, 
and was much more noticeable in the interview than it is in this screen shot).
>>This is from reflection on the boundary. In Wave Interference sim, 
I extend the lattice beyond the visible region;
here it could also be done, but very time consuming to implement, 
and would slow down the sim (scales with the size of the boundary).
>>I checked the x locations of the wave sources, and they are symmetric.

Reset should reset wavelength, velocity,
>>This proves to be very difficult right now (2+ hours?).  After refactoring, should be piece of cake.

If I check and uncheck “slit absorption” with no slits and no barriers, it creates little glitches in the beam.
High Intensity electrons with absorption and one detector gave blank answer in north region
    (although intensity pattern appeared on screen). <can't reproduce this>
When I move the vertical position of the slits, the response is very jerky and discontinuous.  Can this be any smoother?
o Wave function norm is incorrect.  A detector that covers the entire box only registers 80-95%, rather than 100%.
    -this is partly due to the particle leaking outside the box
Allow user to move slit barrier up and down by clicking on it and dragging.
The “slit absorption” checkbox should have no effect if there are no slits or barriers.

o There is an abnormally bright region just beneath the slits in intensity mode with detector(s) on.

Ruler should revise size on resolution change or wave area size change.

Sizes should be relative:
Slits
Wave velocity (hard to do this with a local propagator)

Gun should shrink for small screen size (gun size is now incorrectly dependent on screen size).

Add separate control for box physical size (independent of lattice size)?

Center the Reset All and Clear Wave buttons.
>>This is difficult, given the "all control panels should have the same width" constraint.

Add a close button for the stopwatch.

Modelslider labels have a bug on mac.

Bug: In all panels, if you move the wavelength slider all the way to the left, funny little brown squares flash all over the wave:
>>I Can't reproduce this.
     
In Java version 1.4.2_03, the slider leaves a little trail when you move it 
and has a green rectangle behind the tick marks (see below).  
This problem does not appear in Java version 1.5.0_04 or 1.5.0_06.
>>Very difficult ( interface not exposed, internal bug in Java?).

Initial Wiggle me is hard to see:
If it were a font that is about twice as large, bold,
colored (red maybe) and without a bubble I think it’d be more prominent.
It should enter from the top of the screen and descend
down to the location that it sits in now.
>>Is this still a problem

In Two Lasers panel, the left gun controls go off the screen at 1024x768 resolution:
      >>This problem has minimal visual impact, doesn't interfere with functionality and wouldn't be easy to fix.  I will wait on solving this bug.
      
Detectors in Single Particles Panel:
      •	Each time a detection event occurs, make a note come up that says either “Detection: the _____ is in the detector!” or “Detection: the ______ is NOT in the detector!” where _____ is photon, electrons, etc.
      >>Scratched because we don't know how to handle multiple detectors yet.

"Copy Screen" instances shouldn't appear on top of one another.

Bug: In DoublePhotonWave, getMomentum() is returning with unknown units.

Add save/load of detectors embedded in double-slits?
>>Could be difficult because a save in one panel and load in the second panel could be inconsistent.

•	If I move the wavelength slider all the way to the left, strange spots and stripes appear on the wavelength slider, the wave, and the screen.  If I pause the simulation and move the window around, there seem to be words written on the background behind the spots.  If I take a screen shot, the spots don’t appear on the screenshot.  I swear I’m not making this up.
    o	>>I’ve had trouble reproducing this.

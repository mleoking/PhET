Note that you will need to put scaling back in
    so that the size of the box doesn’t change when you change the resolution in Options.

Because you got rid of the scaling factor, the only measure of the size
of your box is the number of pixels.  Suppose you want to set up your
units so that the box is 60 nm wide.  If your box is 60 pixels wide,
then one pixel equals one nm.  If you change the resolution, the box
should still be 60 nm wide, which means that the way the units relate to
  the grid should change.  I think the way your code is currently set
up, the units are inherently tied to the grid.  A scaling factor would
remove this dependence of the units on the grid, so that changing the
resolution would not change the units.

Rescale both space and time for photons.

Gun should shrink for small screen size (gun size dependent on screen size).

Put the on/off control on top of the gun and make it look like part of the gun.

Move Save/Load to the file menu
Ruler should revise size on resolution change or wave area size change.

Sizes should be relative:
Barriers
Detectors
Slits
Wave velocity

If I check and uncheck “slit absorption” with no slits and no barriers, it creates little glitches in the beam.
High Intensity electrons with absorption and one detector gave blank answer in north region
    (although intensity pattern appeared on screen). <can't reproduce this>
When I move the vertical position of the slits, the response is very jerky and discontinuous.  Can this be any smoother?
o Wave function norm is incorrect.  A detector that covers the entire box only registers 80-95%, rather than 100%.
    -this is partly due to the particle leaking outside the box
Allow user to move slit barrier up and down by clicking on it and dragging.
The “slit absorption” checkbox should have no effect if there are no slits or barriers.

Allow user to change the colors of the two lasers independently.
    If the colors are different, they don’t interfere, just like when there are detectors in the first panel.
    In order to interfere with each other, the colors should be sufficiently similar that they look like the same color,
    but they shouldn’t have to be so close that you go crazy trying to get the sliders in exactly the same place.
    For now, let’s say they interfere if they are within 5 nm of each other,
    but we’ll probably have to tweak it a bit once we see what it looks like.
        -How do we want colors to mix?  Just average them?

o There is an abnormally bright region just beneath the slits in intensity mode with detector(s) on.

Shrink the play area so there is not so much extra space.
     o	What does this mean?

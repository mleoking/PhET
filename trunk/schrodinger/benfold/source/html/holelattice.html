<h2>Holes in a Lattice</h2>

<p>
    This applet shows the motion of holes through a crystal lattice with an external electric field applied. (Although
    it is actually the electrons that are moving, it is often simpler to think of the empty spaces as if they were
    particles moving in the opposite direction.)

    <table border=1>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <applet archive="classes.jar" code="HoleApplet" width=400 height=400>
                </applet>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p>
    The &quot;Show electrons moving&quot; checkbox toggles animation for the electrons. This does not affect the
    behaviour of the electrons or holes (save for a small time delay while the electrons are moving) and is provided
    merely for aesthetic value.

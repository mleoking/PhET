<h2>Absorption, Emission and Feedback</h2>

<p>
    This applet models the interaction between electrons (shown as blue dots) and photons (red squiggles). Five
    processes are modelled: absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission, pumping and feedback; the frequency
    of occurrence of these processes may be set using the text fields provided.

<p>
    The absorption rate is the probability that a photon will be absorbed by any one electron; similarly for the
    stimulated emission rate. The other two rates, for spontaneous emission and pumping are the probability per time
    interval <i>T</i> of those events occurring, where <i>T</i> is the time taken for a photon to travel from one side
    of the display to the other.

<p>
    The feedback rate is the proportion of photons leaving the simulation (by reaching the far right hand side) which
    will be returned to the start. The rate at which photons are leaving the simulation is displayed in the upper right
    corner (photons leaving per interval <i>T</i>), and is plotted against time on the graph below the simulation.

<p>
    The population inversion (proportion of electrons at the upper level) is displayed in the top corner of the applet.
    Using the &quot;inversion&quot; field, this value may be set. When the &quot;apply inversion&quot; button is
    clicked, the electrons will be randomly distributed according to the specified inversion.

    In addition, an inversion of 0 or 1 may be set using the &quot;none excited&quot; or &quot;all excited&quot;
    buttons.

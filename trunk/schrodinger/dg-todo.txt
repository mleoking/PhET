Put on main page:
•	Title “Davisson-Germer: Electron Diffraction.”
•	Blurb for web page: “Simulate the original experiment that proved that electrons can behave as waves.  Watch electrons diffract off a crystal of atoms, interfering with themselves to create peaks and troughs of probability.”

•	 “Atom separation.”  Range should be from 0.4nm to 1.2nm, in increments of 0.1nm.  Default value should be 0.6nm  (note that at low resolution, 1 grid point = 0.1nm)
•	 “Atom radius.”  Range should be from 0.05nm to 0.25nm, in increments of 0.05nm.  Default value should be 0.1nm.

FYI, you probably already know this, but in case you don't, to convert 
the units you are currently using for radius and separation to nm, all 
you need to do is multiply them by 45.

The present units are fractional; so for atom separation:
Current range 0-1
proposed range: 0.4nm to 1.2nm
divide by 45:
0.008 to 0.026
maybe you meant divide by 4.5?


•	When you save a snapshot on the graph, the legend should be labeled with both the velocity and the spacing in real units.

Needs Spanish.

The protractor being off center is more problematic, and I don't 
understand why this can't be fixed easily.

•	The protractor looks a lot like the commercial protractor.
    >>This doesn’t look problematic to me; also I’m not sure what I would change.

# Low Priority

Protractor no longer looks centered on lead atom (off by 1 grid cell or so).  I couldn’t fix this easily.

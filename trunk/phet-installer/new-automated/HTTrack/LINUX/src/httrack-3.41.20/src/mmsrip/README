	MMS Ripper release 0.7.0

These are the release notes for mmsrip version 0.7.0
Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about.


WHAT IS MMSRIP ?

 MMSRIP allows you to save on your hard-disk the content being streamed
 by an MMS server. This program has been written for personnal use, so
 don't blame me if you think I am stupid doing such tool for the others.

 It should run on every POSIX compliant Operating System, but I can't
 give you any complete list.


HOW TO INSTALL ?

 Read the file INSTALL in order to get the answer of this question... ;)
 If you use a gentoo based distribution, enjoy the ebuild script contributed by Aurelien REQUIEM.
 If you use a RPM based distribution, you may use the spec file provided by Frederico SIMONCELLI.


HOW TO RUN ?

 Once you have compiled & installed, you should be able to run the program.


IMPORTANT NOTE

 All the credits go to SDP Multimedia and Major MMS.

It allows you to download a World Wide website from the Internet to a local directory,building recursively all structures, getting html, images, and other files from the server to your computer. Links are rebuiltrelatively so that you can freely browse to the local site (works with any browser). You can mirror several sites together so that you can jump from one toanother. You can, also, update an existing mirror site, or resume an interrupted download. The robot is fully configurable, with an integrated help" />

</ul>

<tt>
<pre>

w  mirror with automatic wizard
This is the default scanning option, the engine automatically scans links according to the default options, and filters defined. It does not prompt a message when a "foreign" link is reached.

W  semi-automatic mirror with help-wizard (asks questions)
This option lets the engine ask the user if a link must be mirrored or not, when a new web has been found.

g  just get files (saved in the current directory)
This option forces the engine not to scan the files indicated - i.e. the engine only gets the files indicated.

i  continue an interrupted mirror using the cache
This option indicates to the engine that a mirror must be updated or continued.

rN  recurse get with limited link depth of N
This option sets the maximum recurse level. Default is infinite (the engine "knows" that it should not go out of current domain)

a   stay on the same address
This is the default primary scanning option, the engine does not go out of domains without permissions (filters, for example)

d   stay on the same principal domain
This option lets the engine go on all sites that exist on the same principal domain.
Example: a link located at www.someweb.com that goes to members.someweb.com will be followed.

l   stay on the same location (.com, etc.)
This option lets the engine go on all sites that exist on the same location.
Example: a link located at www.someweb.com that goes to www.anyotherweb.com will be followed.
Warning: this is a potentially dangerous option, limit the recurse depth with r option.

e   go everywhere on the web
This option lets the engine go on any sites.
Example: a link located at www.someweb.com that goes to www.anyotherweb.org will be followed.
Warning: this is a potentially dangerous option, limit the recurse depth with r option.

n   get non-html files 'near' an html file (ex: an image located outside)
This option lets the engine catch all files that have references on a page, but that exist outside the web site.
Example: List of ZIP files links on a page.

t   test all URLs (even forbidden ones)
This option lets the engine test all links that are not caught.
Example: to test broken links in a site

x   replace external html links by error pages
This option tells the engine to rewrite all links not taken into warning pages.
Example: to browse offline a site, and to warn people that they must be online if they click to external links.

  s2  Always follow site's rules

bN  accept cookies in cookies.txt
This option activates or unactivates the cookie
  b0 do not accept cookies

D   can only go down into subdirs
This is the default option, the engine can go everywhere on the same directoy, or in lower structures

DESCRIPTION OF DIRECTORIES

assets :

   website and all simulations, suitable for installing on a local computer.
   This is useful for people who don't have fast or reliable Internet access.

   All Flash-based simulations live under here.
   
simulations-java :
   All Java-based simulations live under here.
   
team :

   Developers can put whatever they want under their subdirectory (experimental code, etc),
   but should remember that this area is publicly visible.

   PhET Translation Utility lives under here.
   This is a tool that makes it easy for non-developers to translate PhET sims to other languages.

===============================================================================
"To Do" list for "Fourier Analysis" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- flesh out Components view in "Discrete" module

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

LOW PRIORITY:

OPTIMIZATIONS:

CLEANUP:
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

PHETCOMMON:
- bug: JTextField wrapped using PhetJComponent doesn't received ActionEvents or FocusEvents
- bug: when focus moves to Control Panel, PhetJComponet in apparatus panel still appears to have focus (eg, blinking cursor)
- bug: PhetJComponents don't work unless ApparatusPanel has a mouse listener that requests focus
- bug: PhetJComponent doesn't work with JSpinner on Macintosh, looks wrong on Windows & Linux
- bug: JTextField wrapped by a PhetJComponent grows and shrinks as you type text
- bug: must call repaint on a PhetGraphic in order to display its wrapped JComponent properly

DONE:
sandbox-2005-05-10...
(5/10) - flesh out demo of "Amplitudes" view in "Discrete" module
(5/10) - add label and value to harmonic amplitude slider
(5/10) - determine why only 1 harmonic component is shown when dragging slider from more to less
(5/9) - amplitude sliders for harmonics
(5/9) - HarmonicSeries control panel
(5/9) - models for Harmonic and HarmonicSeries
(4/26) - add fourier to CVS loginfo and modules files
(3/30) - set up basic application framework

===============================================================================
"To Do" list for "Fourier" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:


HIGH PRIORITY:
- Sum graph is broken in cosines mode, Y values are flipped for negative X
- animation sync between HarmonicsGraph, SumGraph, PeriodDisplay is complicated -- move to model?
- sync PeriodDisplay
- persistence

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- something is hammering the processor when we should be idle
- control panel resize & apparatus panel repaint problems when switching domains

LOW PRIORITY:
- refactor superclass out of HarmonicsGraphic and SumGraphic (and AmplitudeGraphic?)
- waveform anti-aliasing/stroke visually changes when you start to drag wavelength/period tools
- smaller font for equation subscripts

NEW FEATURES:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- rewrite ZoomControl to use static shapes instead of images
- flatten static elements
- setIgnoreMouse

CLEANUP:
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

CHARTS:
- flatten static graphics elements

PHETCOMMON:
- bug: rendering hints should be appended, not replaced, by PhetGraphic
- bug: PhetTextGraphic leaves screen turds when its text is exclusively Unicode
- bug: PhetJComponent startup is excessively slow
- bug: PhetJComponent doesn't work with JSpinner on Macintosh, looks wrong on Windows & Linux
- bug: PhetJComponent tab traversal doesn't work
- all of the text graphics classes should be combined into PhetTextGraphic

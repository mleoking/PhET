"To Do" list for "Fourier Analysis" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- autorescale checkbox for Components/Sum graphs
- Sums graphic range is +-5 when autoscale is off
- Amplitudes graph range of 4/PI, label -1,0,+1
- zoom in max to show 1/2 cycle, out max to show 4 cycles, root of 2 zoom factors
- X-axis tick marks at L/4 on Components & Sum graphs
- X-axis labels as zoom permits on Components & Sum graphs
- different background behind Components & Sum graphs to group them
- highlight component when mouse moves over it in Amplitudes or Components view
- make SineWaveGraphic capable of traveling animation
- add presets for various Fourier Series (sine, sawtooth, packet, etc.)
- persistence

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- cache trig calculations
- OK to override finalize?

LOW PRIORITY:

OPTIMIZATIONS:

CLEANUP:
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

PHETCOMMON:
- bug: cursor and highlighting don't work in JTextField wrapped by PhetJComponet
- bug: JTextField wrapped using PhetJComponent doesn't received ActionEvents or FocusEvents
- bug: when focus moves to Control Panel, PhetJComponet in apparatus panel still appears to have focus (eg, blinking cursor)
- bug: PhetJComponents don't work unless ApparatusPanel has a mouse listener that requests focus
- bug: PhetJComponent doesn't work with JSpinner on Macintosh, looks wrong on Windows & Linux
- bug: JTextField wrapped by a PhetJComponent grows and shrinks as you type text
- bug: must call repaint on a PhetGraphic in order to display its wrapped JComponent properly

DONE:

"To Do" list for "Fourier" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- fix SubscriptedSymbol graphic

HIGH PRIORITY:

- change length of wavelength & period measurement tools based on chart range
- investigate Jex for rendering equations
- highlight component when mouse moves over it in Harmonics graph
- persistence
- smooth out waveforms

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- refactor superclass out of HarmonicsGraphic and SumGraphic (and AmplitudeGraphic?)
- OK to override finalize?

LOW PRIORITY:
- make graph titles prettier

NEW FEATURES:
- highlight harmonic when its wavelength/period tool has focus

OPTIMIZATIONS:

CLEANUP:
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

CHARTS:
- flatten static graphics elements

PHETCOMMON:
- bug: PhetTextGraphic leaves screen turds when its text is exclusively Unicode
- bug: PhetJComponent uses INT_TYPE_RGB, so alpha is ignored on Mac, can't set transparent backgrounds
- bug: PhetJComponent startup is excessively slow
- bug: PhetJComponent doesn't work with JSpinner on Macintosh, looks wrong on Windows & Linux
- bug: PhetJComponent tab traversal doesn't work
- bug: PhetJComponent uses deprecated reshape method

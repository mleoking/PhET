===============================================================================
"To Do" list for "Fourier" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- change default # harmonics to 11
- change default domain back to "space"
- x-space width is wrong in D2C
- investigate what MegaHelp button will do to control panel, will it add scrollbars?
- add a "show widths" control to D2C control panel
- hook up wiggle me to model so that it disappears when model changes
- bug: x-space width is in the wrong location when D2C Components graph is minimized
- bug: x-space width shouldn't be visible when D2C Sum graph is minimized
- charts: add ability to put a PhetGraphic on the chart at a specified x,y coordinate
- peak of the D2C sum envelope should be used to scale the Sum graph
- add arrows to "width" graphics in D2C
- replace D2C width tools with static graphics that indicate widths (red, double arrows)
- hangs after extended play (~30 minutes)
- remove the clock controls for the D2C module
- add sound to Discrete module

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- add support for persistence
- bug: anti-aliasing of plots gets turned off
- bug: D2C amplitudes graph draws on top of tools (Mac only)
- bug: dragging tools over top of chart causes weird aliasing artifacts (Mac only)
- bug: chart draws plots on top of help items (Mac only)
- add more arrow options to FourierHelp
- something is hammering the processor when the sim should be idle

LOW PRIORITY:
- wiggle me uses the module's clock, so it stops moving when clock is paused
- wiggle me isn't hidden when user clicks in the control panel
- FourierSumPlot should be an observer of its FourierSeries
- get rid of Vector2D if it continues to be used only by WiggleMeGraphic
- break up control panels into reusable subpanels
- grayed out waveforms anti-aliasing/stroke visually changes when you start to drag wavelength/period tools
- MegaHelp

REJECTED:
(9/13) - add equations for Gaussian wave packet above D2C amplitudes graph (voted down by design team)
(9/13) - make Discrete amplitude sliders 50% narrower (not needed)
(9/13) - Discrete x-axis ticks and labeling should be consistent with D2C (zoom levels and symbolic labeling are different)
(9/13) - add ability to show multiple wavelength/period tools in Discrete module (voted down)
(9/8) - smaller font for equation subscripts (fine as is, HTML tags to do this don't work)
(8/30) - display at full-screen resolution on start up? (per Carl as status meeting)
(8/30) - refactor chart config out of HarmonicsChart, SumChart and AmplitudesChart (each chart is different)

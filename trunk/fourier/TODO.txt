"To Do" list for "Fourier" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:


HIGH PRIORITY:
- add support for persistence
- chart draws plots on top of help items (Mac only?)
- anti-aliasing of plots gets turned off
- hide wiggle me when user clicks anywhere
- publish v1r0 with Discrete module only

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- relocate the Help on the text fields in Discrete module
- FourierHelp.pointAt(Point,...) doesn't actually point at the specific Point
- crashes after running for ~40 minutes (memory leak?)
- something is hammering the processor when the sim should be idle

LOW PRIORITY:
- with a single module, Fourier starts up with the module's apparatus panel magnified (something in DiscreteControlPanel)
- FourierSumPlot should be an observer of its FourierSeries
- PeriodDisplay is an observer of its harmonic, should it be?
- get rid of Vector2D if it continues to be used only by WiggleMeGraphic
- break up DiscreteControlPanel into subpanels that can be reused in other modules
- refactor 9chart config?) out of HarmonicsChart, SumChart and AmplitudesChart
- waveform anti-aliasing/stroke visually changes when you start to drag wavelength/period tools
- smaller font for equation subscripts
- Help
- MegaHelp
- Wiggle Mes

NEW FEATURES:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- is allocation of AnimationCycleEvents inefficient?
- SumGraph.update does a lot of Point allocation
- reduce startup time
- flatten static elements
- setIgnoreMouse

CLEANUP:
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

CHARTS:
- Chart.addGraphic needs a layer argument
- flatten static graphics elements

PHETCOMMON:
- bug: MouseEvent and KeyEvent source is always the apparatus panel, should be the "active unit"
- bug: changes in a module's control panel causes the apparatus panel to change size and not repaint
- bug: rendering hints should be appended, not replaced, by PhetGraphic
- bug: PhetTextGraphic leaves screen turds when its text is exclusively Unicode
- bug: PhetJComponent startup is excessively slow
- bug: PhetJComponent doesn't work with JSpinner on Macintosh, looks wrong on Windows & Linux
- bug: PhetJComponent tab traversal doesn't work if component is invisible or has been removed
- all of the text graphics classes should be combined into PhetTextGraphic
- add the ability to attach help items to phetgraphics

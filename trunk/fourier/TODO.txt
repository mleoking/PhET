===============================================================================
"To Do" list for "Fourier Analysis" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- label axes on ComponentsGraphic
- optimize memory allocation in ComponentsGraphic
- make SineWaveGraphic capable of traveling animation
- add presets for various Fourier Series (sine, sawtooth, packet, etc.)
- persistence

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- OK to override finalize?

LOW PRIORITY:

OPTIMIZATIONS:

CLEANUP:
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

PHETCOMMON:
- bug: JTextField wrapped using PhetJComponent doesn't received ActionEvents or FocusEvents
- bug: when focus moves to Control Panel, PhetJComponet in apparatus panel still appears to have focus (eg, blinking cursor)
- bug: PhetJComponents don't work unless ApparatusPanel has a mouse listener that requests focus
- bug: PhetJComponent doesn't work with JSpinner on Macintosh, looks wrong on Windows & Linux
- bug: JTextField wrapped by a PhetJComponent grows and shrinks as you type text
- bug: must call repaint on a PhetGraphic in order to display its wrapped JComponent properly

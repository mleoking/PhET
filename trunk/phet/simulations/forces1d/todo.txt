Force1D Known Bugs (in order of severity):
•	Chris says force1d doesn’t run on a Mac.
•	Wall force doesn’t appear during playback.
•	Adding barriers during a recording session has the wrong behavior on playback.

I just ran the version of Force1D that's on the PhET website.
Sim version is v1r4, Mac OS 10.3.9, Java 1.4.2_09.

The control panel has serious problems when "More Controls"
is pressed, see attached snapshot.  Combobox contents are
clipped, and I assume there are a bunch of missing sliders?...

FYI, the Ramp has the same combobox problem, and some buttons that 
require setOpaque(false).

Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: 6/21/05-6/27/05 (Tue-Mon)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Fourier simulation:
    o continued work on "Discrete" module, including:
    o relocated sound controls to "Sound & Music" module
    o completed Math Mode
    o implemented "Show function with infinite number of harmonics"
    o added animation in space-&-time mode
    o set initial location of wavelength and period tools
    o pie-chart period tool for space-&-time mode
    o improved the smoothness of waveforms
    o reduced the number of points needed to approximate waveforms
    
  phetcommon:
    o fixed model-view transforms (ModelViewTransform2D) to use double precision

  charts:
    o added support for sine/cosine functions (SinePlot)
    o fixed model-view transforms (Charts, LinePlot, ScatterPlot) to use double precision
    
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  o continue work on Fourier (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/fourier/TODO.txt)

ISSUES:

  o due tothe absence of requirements, the Fourier "Wave Pulse Shaper" will not be available for AAPT
  o I will be on vacation July 1-7
  o I will not be able to attend the status meetings on July 5 or 12

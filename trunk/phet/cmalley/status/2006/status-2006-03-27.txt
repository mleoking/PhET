PERIOD: 3/21/06-03/27/06 (Tue-Mon)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Quantum Tunneling:
  - major improvement in graphics performance by rewriting JFreeChart renderer
  - major improvement in performance on Java 1.5 by setting interpolation method (Sam Reid)
  - major improvement in damping of boundary reflection and circularity
  - changed position range to [-4,+8]
  - added color schemes (presets and custom)
  - added Developer menu for accessing Richardson Controls dialog

PERIOD: Dec 07 - Dec 13, 2006 (Thu-Wed)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Hydrogen Atom:
  - fixed remaining problems with deBroglie 3D view
  - improved performance of deBroglie 3D rotation
  - implemented a solution to the Schrodinger equation in 3D
  - mapped the 3D Schrodinger solution to 2D (the 3rd dimension is mapped to rightness)
  - identified an open source solution to the Associated Legendre Polynomial
  - identified problems with Schrodinger state transitions rules in the design doc
  - published 0.00.15
  
  Bound States:
  - changed the range of the electric field
  - published 1.02 to the PhET website (will be included with new Installer)

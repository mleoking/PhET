WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  o continue work on Quantum Tunneling, see: 
    http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/quantum-tunneling/TODO.txt

  o start work on Bound States, see: 
    http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/bound-states/TODO.txt
    
ISSUES:

  o Lots of open issues in Bound States design, too early to start implementing?

  o I've run out of things to do.

  -----------------------------------------------

  We are currently developing Piccolo, a "scenegraph" for use in 2D graphics.
  One of our ultimate goals is to support Swing lightweight components
  within Piccolo, whose graphical space supports arbitray affine transforms.
  The challenge in this pursuit is getting the components to respond and
  render properly though not actually displayed in a standard Java component
  hierarchy.


  The first issues involved making the Swing components focusable and
  showing.  This was accomplished by adding the Swing components to a 0x0
  JComponent which was in turn added to our main Piccolo application component.
  To our good fortune, a Java component is showing merely if it and its
  ancestors are showing and not based on whether it is ACTUALLY visible.
  Likewise, focus in a JComponent depends merely on the component's
  containing window having focus.


  The second issue involved capturing the repaint calls on a Swing
  component.  Normally, for a repaint and the consequent call to
  paintImmediately, a Swing component obtains the Graphics object necessary
  to render itself through the Java component heirarchy.  However, for Piccolo
  we would like the component to render using a Graphics object that Piccolo
  may have arbitrarily transformed in some way.  By capturing in the
  RepaintManager the repaint calls made on our special Swing components, we
  are able to redirect the repaint requests through the Piccolo architecture to
  put the Graphics in its proper context.  Unfortunately, this means that
  if the Swing component contains other Swing components, then any repaint
  requests made by one of these nested components must go through
  the Piccolo architecture then through the top level Swing component
  down to the nested Swing component.  This normally doesn't cause a
  problem.  However, if calling paint on one of these nested
  children causes a call to repaint then an infinite loop ensues.  This does
  in fact happen in the Swing components that use cell renderers.  Before
  the cell renderer is painted, it is invalidated and consequently
  repainted.  We solved this problem by putting a lock on repaint calls for
  a component while that component is painting.  (A similar problem faced
  the Swing team over this same issue.  They solved it by inserting a
  CellRendererPane to capture the renderer's invalidate calls.)


  Another issue arose over the forwarding of mouse events to the Swing
  components.  Since our Swing components are not actually displayed on
  screen in the standard manner, we must manually dispatch any MouseEvents
  we want the component to receive.  Hence, we needed to find the deepest
  visible component at a particular location that accepts MouseEvents.
  Finding the deepest visible component at a point was achieved with the
  "findComponentAt" method in java.awt.Container.  With the
  "getListeners(Class listenerType)" method added in JDK1.3 Beta we are able
  to determine if the component has any Mouse Listeners. However, we haven't
  yet found a way to determine if MouseEvents have been specifically enabled
  for a component. The package private method "eventEnabled" in
  java.awt.Component does exactly what we want but is, of course,
  inaccessible.  In order to dispatch events correctly we would need a
  public accessor to the method "boolean eventEnabled(AWTEvent)" in
  java.awt.Component.


  Still another issue involves the management of cursors when the mouse is
  over a Swing component in our application.  To the Java mechanisms, the
  mouse never appears to enter the bounds of the Swing components since they
  are contained by a 0x0 JComponent.  Hence, we must manually change the
  cursor when the mouse enters one of the Swing components in our
  application. This generally works but becomes a problem if the Swing
  component's cursor changes while we are over that Swing component (for
  instance, if you resize a Table Column).  In order to manage cursors
  properly, we would need setCursor to fire property change events.


  With the above fixes, most Swing components work.  The only Swing
  components that are definitely broken are ToolTips and those that rely on
  JPopupMenu. In order to implement ToolTips properly, we would need to have
  a method in ToolTipManager that allows us to set the current manager, as
  is possible with RepaintManager.  In order to implement JPopupMenu, we
  will likely need to reimplement JPopupMenu to function in Piccolo with
  a transformed Graphics and to insert itself in the proper place in the
  Piccolo scenegraph.

/**
 * <b>PSwing</b> is used to add Swing Components to a Piccolo canvas.
 * <p/>
 * Example: adding a swing JButton to a PCanvas:
 * <pre>
 *     PSwingCanvas canvas = new PSwingCanvas();
 *     JButton button = new JButton("Button");
 *     swing = new PSwing(canvas, button);
 *     canvas.getLayer().addChild(swing);
 * <pre>
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: PSwing has the current limitation that it does not listen for
 *       Container events.  This is only an issue if you create a PSwing
 *       and later add Swing components to the PSwing's component hierarchy
 *       that do not have double buffering turned off or have a smaller font
 *       size than the minimum font size of the original PSwing's component
 *       hierarchy.
 * <p/>
 *       For instance, the following bit of code will give unexpected
 *       results:
 *       <pre>
 *            JPanel panel = new JPanel();
 *            PSwing swing = new PSwing(panel);
 *            JPanel newChild = new JPanel();
 *            newChild.setDoubleBuffered(true);
 *            panel.add(newChild);
 *       </pre>
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: PSwing cannot be correctly interacted with through multiple cameras.
 * There is no support for it yet.
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: PSwing is java.io.Serializable.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Warning:</b> Serialized objects of this class will not be
 * compatible with future Piccolo releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the
 * same version of Piccolo. A future release of Piccolo will provide support for long
 * term persistence.

- Memory leak in multiple atom panel
- Enable photons emitted on high-to-mid state transitions
- add CollimatedBeamGraphic, or CollimatedBeamView class
- Change interpolation method that creates middle and high energy atom graphics.
- spontaneousEmmisionHalfLife and SpontaneousEmissionTime methods are confusing
- Line 34 in GroundState has a call that has terrible style
- Change location constants in BaseLaserModule to key off location of laser instead of s_origin
- Change internal rep of CollimatedBeam to get rid of x,y,width,height and just use the Rectangle2D

- Debug library, with ClockControlPanel
Should we keep or toss TxTranslatable, TxGraphic, TxBoundary, if we keep, can we conglomerate?

Refactor ModelViewTx2D and AffineTxUtil

-------------------------------------------------
- Increase magnification of middle and high energy states
- Make energy levels mouse-able
    - Make AtomicState classes singletons
- Make state lifetimes dependent on energy level

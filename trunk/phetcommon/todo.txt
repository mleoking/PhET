=======
Add command line parm to get a FrameRateReporter
Replace CompositeMouseListener with an EventChannel

We will use the native L&F for the particular platform we are on.

ApplicationModel will go away.

PhetApplication will create a frame and default clock in its constructor. Constructor will get command line
arguments. PhetApplication will have setters for all the things it needs to have to work, and check that they
are all set in start(). Style of programming will be thatwe subclass PhetApplication.

Settable colors will be background for panels, sliders, etc. (they will all be the same), and button color.

Font size will be settable.

Border labels will be same font and size as other controls.

SimStrings.init() will be called in the PhetApplication constructor

PhetGraphic - Chris
    setLocation( Point)
    setLocation( int x, int y );
    getLocation()
    getBounds()
    setSize()
    getWidth()
    getHeight()
    getX()
    getY()
    deprecate setPosition()
    deprecate push/popRenderingHints()

CompositeGraphic
    rename

CompositePhetGraphic  - Ron & Sam
x    setLocation() should affect everything
x    same of similar methods
    redraw minimum number of pixels

x    children know absolute locations
x    children are added at absolute coordinates

x    PhetGraphic has reference to CompositePhetGraphic in which it is contained, if it is.
x        Manages visibility
x        May be used to manage relative/absolute location.

Events/Listeners - entire cast
    Use AWT2 event model going forward
    retrofit as needed

DefaultInteractiveGraphic
    make it a PhetGraphic

CompositePhetGraphic
    needs to implement InteractiveGraphic

PhetShapeGraphic - Chris
    change names to setStrokeColor() setFillColor()

PhetImageGraphic - Ron
    setLocation() sets a position independent of the transform.
    determineBounds() should return null if image hasn't been set.

Misc - Ron
    check paint() of PhetGraphic subclasses
    rewrite GraphicsState to check what things need to be restored in restoreState();
        also, handle paintMode & XORMode

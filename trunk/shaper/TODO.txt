"To Do" list for "Optical Pulse Shaper" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:


HIGH PRIORITY:
- show a "kaboom" graphic when the molecule explodes
- how close do we have to be to match the output pulse?
- different molecule graphic for each output pulse preset
- magnifying glass graphic for molecule
- add Help>Explanation dialog


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- separate model & view for molecule animation
- wait cursors
- Spanish translations
- make amplitude sliders 254 pixels tall so that every value can be achieved


LOW PRIORITY:


NEW FEATURES:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setIgnoreMouse


CLEANUP:
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors


PHETCOMMON:
- clip should be in specifiable in local coordinate, but it currently needs to be in global coordinates


DONE:
(10/25/05) - calculate "closeness" using Mike Dubson's formula
(10/25/05) - slow down the molecule animation, make the acceleration rate configurable
(10/25/05) - put the molecule animation in the top-most graphics layer
(10/25/05) - make the molecule parts travel across the entire apparatus panel when it explodes (no clip)
(10/25/05) - remove the "Show output pulse" control
(10/25/05) - put "New output pulse" button on output pulse view
(10/25/05) - change alpha of light beam to match amplitudes
(10/25/05) - change title to "Optical Quantum Control", per Carl
0.0.2 ...
(10/24/05) - setIgnoreMouse(true) where ever possible
(10/24/05) - physically connect molecule animation to output pulse view
(10/24/05) - molecule animation
(10/21/05) - convert all uses of PhetTextGraphic to HTMLGraphic, fix locations
(10/21/05) - phetcommon: create PhetTextGraphic2 to fix serious registration problems
(10/21/05) - sync all views before the GameManager tells us we've won
(10/21/05) - make graph backgrounds wider so that x-axis label isn't clipped on Windows
0.0.1 ...
(10/20/05) - don't test for a match while an amplitude slider is being dragged
(10/20/05) - replace CheatDialog with a PhetGraphic that is positioned above amplitude sliders
(10/20/05) - bugfix in EasyGridBagLayout.setInsets
(10/20/05) - add "Cheat" dialog
(10/20/05) - add Help items to amplitude controls
(10/20/05) - move "How close am I?" out of control panel and into animation area
(10/20/05) - add rainbow light beams going from the gratings to the mirrors
(10/20/05) - add white light beams going from the graphs to the gratings
(10/20/05) - calculate and set value for "How close am I?" readout
(10/20/05) - change closeness readout to a JTextField so that it updates (JLabel wouldn't update)
(10/20/05) - wire up "New Output Pulse" control
(10/20/05) - wire up "Show goal pulse shape" control
(10/20/05) - set amplitudes of output pulse waveform
(10/20/05) - use pink color from A11 of Fourier for the output pulse color
(10/20/05) - add correct input pulse waveform: F(t)=Exp[-((10 pi t)^2)/2]
(10/20/05) - reposition graphs so bottom of output pulse graph isn't cut off
(10/20/05) - change violet RGB values at SamM's request
(10/19/05) - everything should be in cosine, not sine, mode
(10/19/05) - 75% of the user interface implemented, most of the model implemented
(10/18/05) - hide clock controls
(10/18/05) - set up dev/shaper subdirectory in PhET development area
(10/18/05) - add entires in CVSROOT/loginfo and modules files
(10/18/05) - checked into CVS as project "shaper"
(10/18/05) - set up the application framework

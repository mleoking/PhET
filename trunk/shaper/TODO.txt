"To Do" list for "Optical Pulse Shaper" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:


HIGH PRIORITY:
- magnifying glass graphic for molecule
- fill in contents of Explanation dialog
- add Help items


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- Help item for amplitude sliders doesn't always point to a slider
- Help item for amplitude text fields doesn't always point to a text field
- resize the molecule graphics that are currently scaled
- separate the model & view for molecule animation
- wait cursors
- Spanish translations
- make amplitude sliders 254 pixels tall so that every value can be achieved by dragging


LOW PRIORITY:
- add more arrow locations to ShaperHelpItem


NEW FEATURES:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setIgnoreMouse


CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors


PHETCOMMON:
- clip should be in specifiable in local coordinate, but it currently needs to be in global coordinates


DONE:

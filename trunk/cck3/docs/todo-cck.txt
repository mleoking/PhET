I would say that the CCK DC-AC 
version should be replaced, but NOT the old DC version yet. Of the 
new bugs, I thought the redrawing problems (when under heavy task) 
where the most important to fix now if possible.

Chris's bugs.
-Bug 12: Not worried about this for short term.
-Bug 15: FIXED on my computer (?)
-Bug 16: Also a problem in current version online
-Bug 25: Needs to be fixed at some point ... old version doesn't have 
this problem but is worse than current problem
-Bug 26: Good compromise.
-Bug 33: Also a problem on current version online

- When has complex circuit... sim doesn't refresh correctly when 
"unhidden" ... that is when minimizing a window that is in front of 
sim to reveal sim. (Only part with moving electrons refreshes under 
these conditions).

- When sim has a lot of circuits going ... the right click window 
does not get drawn correctly ... nothing appears in the window.

- Is there a way to have the computer detect when the sim is 
completely obscured by another window, and then make it stop running 
at that point ... right now to get it to stop you have to minimize.

I’m having some problem saving sim files, though. No dialogue box 
appears to save, or re-save files with. Could this be a bug in the upgrade?

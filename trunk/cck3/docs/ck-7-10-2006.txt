-I noticed the same performance issues as Kathy.  As soon as there were many 
components in the play area, things got bogged down.

-When I have 2 caps in series with a bulb and battery and turned the voltage 
up rather high, only one of the caps catches on fire (the one near the 
battery).  See cck_fire.gif.

-When you have 2 caps in the play area and you turn one of them 180 degrees 
around, it looks a little strange next to the other one that has not been 
turned around--sort of an MC Escher effect.  See cck_escher.gif.

-I noticed the plus and minus signs on the caps are sometimes near other 
objects (when there are only 3 charges present) and it makes it hard to see 
them.  Possibly the charges could be moved a few pixels away from other 
objects? (see cck_charge_signs.gif)

-There's a slight issues with the capacitors.  I charged up two identical 
capacitor at different voltages (100 V and 10 V) so that there are different 
amounts of charges on them.  Then, I removed the charged caps from their 
circuits (see cck_caps_separate.gif).  I connected the positive side of one 
cap to the negative side of the other cap.  I expected to see the charges on 
these two connected plates redistribute themselves, but nothing happened. 
(see cck_caps_together.gif).  When you connect the outside plates of this 2 
cap combo with some wires, the charges on the plates then properly 
distribute themselves.

-On that same note, when I had 2 independent charged capacitors (not 
attached to anything else) it was sometimes hard to grab them with the 
cursor and move them.  When you click on them, they would not be highlighted 
in yellow like usual.

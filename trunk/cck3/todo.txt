#Remaining Work
#######################
o Add inductors.
o Internationalize new material.
o Visualization for charge flow across capacitor
o Visualization for charge buildup on capacitor.
o Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.
o Get the time units to work out correctly.

CCK charge visualization
use + and - inside plate graphic
plate graphic should be schematic always
plate charge should build as 1:1 (until maxed out)

Add a timer.
Add inductors
CCK Bug: 'Advanced' disappears on control panel.
Could set node voltages from the MNA, then use that to compute voltmeter readouts (instead of graph theory computation).

Is the ac current (in a circuit with capacitor) symmetric?

################################################
#Lower Priority
#######################
Help button should be moved south.
o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

There is a noticeable delay when dragging a component from the toolbox for the first time; this has confused some users.
Bug: capacitor clips are clipping all electrons, not just electrons in that branch of the circuit

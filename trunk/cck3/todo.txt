Quantitative graph values.

Floating graph needs units.

Editing an inductor or capacitor should take effect immediately.

See faraday's AC source graphics

o Get the time units to work out correctly.

o Is the ac current (in a circuit with capacitor) symmetric?
    o If not, is the asymmetry correct?

Quantitative CCK can wait until after AAPT

-However, when there were two circuits running in the play area, there was 
definitely a decrease in performance and things ran a bit slower.  If you 
grab a wire, say, from the tool bar and drag it around in the play area, 
there is a noticeable lag between the cursor and the wire moving with it.

-When you have an AC voltage source and a light bulb in series and turn the 
frequency to 10 Hz, it looks like the current drifts slightly (counter 
clockwise) as it oscillates back and forth.  I put the mouse cursor next to 
one of the blue dots and watched how one particular blue dot moves over 
time.  Every 10 secs or so, the current stutters ever so slightly and shifts 
the current over.  This seems like a very small/minor problem, but I'm not 
sure if it's effects can be easily seen with a more complicated circuit.

Help button should be moved south.
o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

There is a noticeable delay when dragging a component from the toolbox for the first time; this has confused some users.

Bug: capacitor clips are clipping all electrons, not just electrons in that branch of the circuit

Explain and remove fudge factor for capacitor in MNASolution?

-If you build a simple circuit (battery, resistor, capacitor, and wires in 
series) and wiggle an element or node back and forth around with the mouse, 
the blue balls stop flowing from a node 2 or 3 nodes clock-wise from the 
element or node you are moving around.  The blue balls stop flowing through 
this particular node, but the rest keep on flowing, so you get a wire or 
element with an absence of blue balls because they all flow out.  This may 
be due to the fact that the wire has to redraw the number of blue balls 
because wiggling an element or node changes the number of blue balls 
(according to its length).

o Set node voltages from the MNA, then use that to compute voltmeter readouts (instead of complex and error-prone graph theory computation).

Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.

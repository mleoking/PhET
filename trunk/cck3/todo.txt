#Remaining Work
#######################
o Schematic icons for ac & capacitors
o Improved toolbar for advanced components.
o Add inductors.
o Internationalize new material.
o Visualization for charge flow across capacitor
o Visualization for charge buildup on capacitor.
o Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.
o Get the time units to work out correctly.

Questions:
Do we want current sources?  Physics is already implemented.
How should capacitors look with respect to charge, current and voltage drop?

#Lower Priority
#######################
Help button should be moved south.
There is some text near the top left of the screen; we can see the descenders dropping down.
o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

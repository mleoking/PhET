#Remaining Work
#######################
o Schematic icons for ac & capacitors
o Improved toolbar for advanced components.
o Add inductors.
o Internationalize new material.
o Readout for ac frequency and amplitude. (It is presently instantaneous voltage and internal resistance).
o Visualization for charge flow across capacitor
o Visualization for charge buildup on capacitor.
o Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.
o Capacitors & AC elements cannot be saved or loaded.

Questions:
Do we want current sources?  Physics is already implemented.

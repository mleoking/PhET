CCK (notes from 7-5-2006)
Add the Voltage chart: a 2-terminal version of the current meter.
2-d capacitor for CCK
inductors should auto-discharge when not in a loop.
capacitor charges should be blue for negative, red for +
square plates in 3d
area is a function of capacitance.
floating graph needs units
quantitative CCK can wait until after AAPT
editing an inductor or capacitor should take effect immediately
floatable timer
Faraday's AC Source
in meeting, time-series charts looked non-smooth for simple AC RC circuit
See faraday's AC source graphics

o Get the time units to work out correctly.
o Add Delete button for charts.
o Add a timer.
o Is the ac current (in a circuit with capacitor) symmetric?
o Set node voltages from the MNA, then use that to compute voltmeter readouts (instead of complex graph theory computation).

o When a non-battery branch is removed from the RL circuit, inductor still oscillates internally (is that maybe physical?)

>>At the bottom: there is a description of a real world (nonideal) inductor.  Maybe we should model something like this.

>>has a believable explanation, might be good to model.

o Visualization for charge flow across capacitor
o Visualization for charge buildup on capacitor.
One issue that I see with the way charge is represented is that the 
capacitor looks like it gets fully charged (ie, plus and minus signs stop 
appearing on the cap plates), and current still flows through the capacitor. 
This only happens under certain settings (eg, high voltage).  Another issue 
is that the capacitor will appear fully charged at a low capacitance 
(maximum number of plus and minus signs appear), and then when you increase 
the capacitance, the capacitor still fully changes with the same number of 
maximum plus and minus signs.  It appears at first that the amount of charge 
on the fully charged capacitor is the same in both cases (low and high 
capacitance).  These issues could be a little confusing for students.

-When you have an AC voltage source (10 volts) connected to a light bulb, 
things don't quite look right at frequencies above, say, 5 Hz.  At 10 Hz, 
you get this weird effect where current vs. time chart is modulated--you 
expect to see a smooth sine wave, but you instead get something else (see 
attached).  It seems that this problem may be due to all the other circuits 
on the screen at the same time.  When I created this same circuit on a blank 
slate, the problem went away.  Maybe just a performance issue?

-On that same note, the yellow light rays coming from the bulb in the 
circuit described above tend to stutter and don't always flash consistently.

Floating graph should have tick mark labels on the vertical scale.

Quantitative graph values.

CCK detectors should readout empty data while off of wires.

Chart button should have icon, be located next to other measurement tools in the control panel.

Capacitor charges don't paint correctly.

o Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.

Chart range is incorrect for first part of data.

#Lower Priority
#######################
Help button should be moved south.
o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

There is a noticeable delay when dragging a component from the toolbox for the first time; this has confused some users.

Bug: capacitor clips are clipping all electrons, not just electrons in that branch of the circuit

Explain and remove fudge factor for capacitor in MNASolution?

-If you build a simple circuit (battery, resistor, capacitor, and wires in 
series) and wiggle an element or node back and forth around with the mouse, 
the blue balls stop flowing from a node 2 or 3 nodes clock-wise from the 
element or node you are moving around.  The blue balls stop flowing through 
this particular node, but the rest keep on flowing, so you get a wire or 
element with an absence of blue balls because they all flow out.  This may 
be due to the fact that the wire has to redraw the number of blue balls 
because wiggling an element or node changes the number of blue balls 
(according to its length).

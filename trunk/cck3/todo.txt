#Remaining Work
#######################
Quantitative graph values.

Floating graph needs units.

Editing an inductor or capacitor should take effect immediately.

See faraday's AC source graphics

o Get the time units to work out correctly.

o Is the ac current (in a circuit with capacitor) symmetric?
    o If not, is the asymmetry correct?

Quantitative CCK can wait until after AAPT

################################################
#Lower Priority
#######################
Help button should be moved south.
o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

There is a noticeable delay when dragging a component from the toolbox for the first time; this has confused some users.

Bug: capacitor clips are clipping all electrons, not just electrons in that branch of the circuit

Explain and remove fudge factor for capacitor in MNASolution?

-If you build a simple circuit (battery, resistor, capacitor, and wires in 
series) and wiggle an element or node back and forth around with the mouse, 
the blue balls stop flowing from a node 2 or 3 nodes clock-wise from the 
element or node you are moving around.  The blue balls stop flowing through 
this particular node, but the rest keep on flowing, so you get a wire or 
element with an absence of blue balls because they all flow out.  This may 
be due to the fact that the wire has to redraw the number of blue balls 
because wiggling an element or node changes the number of blue balls 
(according to its length).

o Set node voltages from the MNA, then use that to compute voltmeter readouts (instead of complex and error-prone graph theory computation).

Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.

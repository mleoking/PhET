#Remaining Work
#######################
o Improved toolbar for advanced components.
o Add inductors.
o Internationalize new material.
o Visualization for charge flow across capacitor
o Visualization for charge buildup on capacitor.
o Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.
o Get the time units to work out correctly.

CCK charge visualization
use + and - inside plate graphic
plate graphic should be schematic always
plate charge should build as 1:1 (until maxed out)
Add a timer.
Add inductors
CCK Bug: 'Advanced' disappears on control panel.
Ask Wendy & Chris if there should be a separate toolbar for dynamic components.
Add floating graph components for reading current.
Could set node voltages from the MNA, then use that to compute voltmeter readouts (instead of graph theory computation).

################################################
#Lower Priority
#######################
Help button should be moved south.
o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

There is a noticeable delay when dragging a component from the toolbox for the first time; this has confused some users.

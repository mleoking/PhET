#Remaining Work
#######################
o Internationalize new material. (needs spanish for some text).
o Visualization for charge flow across capacitor
o Visualization for charge buildup on capacitor.
o Quantitative numerical tests for RC, RLC Circuits, etc.
o Get the time units to work out correctly.
o Add schematic view for inductors.
o Add Delete button for charts.
o Add a timer.
o Bug: 'Advanced' disappears on control panel.
o Bug: Capacitor clip should disappear when capacitors disappear.
o Is the ac current (in a circuit with capacitor) symmetric?
o Set node voltages from the MNA, then use that to compute voltmeter readouts (instead of complex graph theory computation).
o When a non-battery branch is removed from the RL circuit, inductor still oscillates internally (is that maybe physical?)

One issue that I see with the way charge is represented is that the 
capacitor looks like it gets fully charged (ie, plus and minus signs stop 
appearing on the cap plates), and current still flows through the capacitor. 
This only happens under certain settings (eg, high voltage).  Another issue 
is that the capacitor will appear fully charged at a low capacitance 
(maximum number of plus and minus signs appear), and then when you increase 
the capacitance, the capacitor still fully changes with the same number of 
maximum plus and minus signs.  It appears at first that the amount of charge 
on the fully charged capacitor is the same in both cases (low and high 
capacitance).  These issues could be a little confusing for students.

#Lower Priority
#######################
Help button should be moved south.
o Improve the approximation for determining capacitor current.
-Could use solution from companion model, but more difficult to code.

There is a noticeable delay when dragging a component from the toolbox for the first time; this has confused some users.
Bug: capacitor clips are clipping all electrons, not just electrons in that branch of the circuit

Explain and remove fudge factor for capacitor in MNASolution?

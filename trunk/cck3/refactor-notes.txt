To Do:

bulb loaded incorrectly one time

improve component constructor interface

unconnected circuit with switch & ac had buggy electron flow

readout graphics are not removed when component is removed

editing a component should show it's Readout value (by the component)

exception:

java.lang.RuntimeException: Juncitons Not at same coordinates.

Issues/Questions

Schematic mode bulb graphic?
sometimes junctions bump off each other too easily?

For flame graphics: I'm ignoring bulb (already pretty exciting when current is high)
and capacitor (maybe not realistic, also code wasn't free); is this okay?

light bulb connect at left (from popup menu) broken.  Should I add this back, or is it unnecessary?  (Not easy to add, since it involves 
altering the underlying circuit model).

is capacitor graphic performance too slow?

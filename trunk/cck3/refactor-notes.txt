- Build second module for Piccolo version
    - This will give us a stable PhetGraphics version for function and
        performance comparisons, plus many other likely benefits, yet
        to be imagined, that will emerge as we go. 
- Two model layers: one for topology, one for topography?

make sure both junctions can't stick to same destination junction.

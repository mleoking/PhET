To Do:

bulb loaded incorrectly one time

unconnected circuit with switch & ac had buggy electron flow

exception:

Issues/Questions

Schematic mode bulb graphic?
sometimes junctions bump off each other too easily?

For flame graphics: I'm ignoring bulb (already pretty exciting when current is high)
and capacitor (maybe not realistic, also code wasn't free); is this okay?

light bulb connect at left (from popup menu) broken.  Should I add this back, or is it unnecessary?  (Not easy to add, since it involves 
altering the underlying circuit model).

is capacitor graphic performance too slow?

improve component constructor interface?  Now there is basically support for cck data structure usage and for MNA usage.

To Do:
Schematic mode lever graphic.
Schematic mode bulb graphic.
sometimes junctions bump off each other too easily?
zoom (small med large)?

bulb loaded incorrectly
editing a component should show it's Readout value (by the component)
improve component constructor interface

Comments:
For flame graphics: I'm ignoring bulb (already pretty exciting when current is high)
and capacitor (maybe not realistic, also code wasn't free).

capacitor clip for electrons (electrons should look like they enter and leave plates).
 
 light bulb connect at left (from popup menu) broken
 
 unconnected circuit with switch & ac had buggy electron flow

To Do:
Schematic mode bulb graphic.
sometimes junctions bump off each other too easily?

bulb loaded incorrectly one time
improve component constructor interface

switching back and forth between schematic & lifelike causes performance degradation; possibly because listeners are not removed.

Comments:
For flame graphics: I'm ignoring bulb (already pretty exciting when current is high)
and capacitor (maybe not realistic, also code wasn't free).

capacitor clip for electrons (electrons should look like they enter and leave plates).
 
 light bulb connect at left (from popup menu) broken
 
unconnected circuit with switch & ac had buggy electron flow

add flame graphic on top (it went underneath images)

readout graphics are not removed when component is removed
editing a component should show it's Readout value (by the component)

exception:

java.lang.RuntimeException: Juncitons Not at same coordinates.

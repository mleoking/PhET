To Do:

Should I ensure the bulb comes out perfectly upright on creation (it comes out at slight angle)?

bulb loaded incorrectly one time

unconnected circuit with switch & ac had buggy electron flow

exception:
java.lang.RuntimeException: Juncitons Not at same coordinates.

Issues/Questions:

Should we have a schematic mode bulb graphic?

Do junctions sometimes bump off each other too easily?

For flame graphics: I'm ignoring bulb (already pretty exciting when current is high)
and capacitor (maybe not realistic, also code wasn't free); is this okay?

Light bulb connect at left (from popup menu) broken.  Should I add this back, or is it unnecessary?  (Not easy to add, since it involves 
altering the underlying circuit model).

Is capacitor graphic performance too slow?

Should I hide ohm readouts for wires?

Should the about dialog discuss Hewlett, Kavli, NSF? 

Internal:
Improve component constructor interface?  Now there is basically support for cck data structure usage and for MNA usage.

- The default size of the bulb, the battery, the voltmeter, and the width of the light bulb brightness lines is quite a bit larger (~30%) than the default size in phet graphics. I prefer the phet graphics sizes as default. 

-I ran into a couple bugs when trying to change the resistance of a light bulb in a 2 bulbs in series circuit. 
        1. The 1st bulb I put into this circuit is the one on the left. When I right click on that the adjustment screen comes up quickly and with no Java logo at the bottom. 
        2. The 2nd bulb is the one on the right (but in the circuit). When I right click on it, the window takes longer to come up and the Java logo strip stays as the bottom. When I do this however, it often causes the bulb to jump around when I right click on it. 
        3. The 3rd bulb, the one not connected, when I right click on it, the window never finishes coming up (see screen shot below). 

- When I switch between email and the sim, the whole screen does not redraw itself so everything except for where the electrons are moving is grey until I click on one of the light bulbs ... and then it will redraw that lightbulbs rectangle. I guess you just need to redraw the whole thing when the sim becomes the computers focus window again. 

- One of the bulbs left behind it's little red dashed circle at one point, but I don't know how reproducible this is.

To Do:

bulb loaded incorrectly one time

unconnected circuit with switch & ac had buggy electron flow

Add a decent about dialog.

Issues/Questions:

Should we have a schematic mode bulb graphic?

Do junctions sometimes bump off each other too easily?

For flame graphics: I'm ignoring bulb (already pretty exciting when current is high)
and capacitor (maybe not realistic, also code wasn't free); is this okay?

Light bulb connect at left (from popup menu) broken.  Should I add this back, or is it unnecessary?  (Not easy to add, since it involves 
altering the underlying circuit model).

Is capacitor graphic performance too slow?

Should I hide ohm readouts for wires?

Internal:
Improve component constructor interface?  Now there is basically support for cck data structure usage and for MNA usage.

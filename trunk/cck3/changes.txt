3.01.06
Charts can now be removed.
Bugfix: Charts don't show any data, when first data points are out of range.
Bugfix: Time-series charts looked non-smooth for simple AC RC circuit
>>We can no longer have simulation time dynamic because it destroys smoothness of the plots; converted to static.
Added x and y axis labels for the stripcharts.
Added the Voltage chart: a 2-terminal version of the current meter.
Added a timer.

3.01.05 (7-5-2006)

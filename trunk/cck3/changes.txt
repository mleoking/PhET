3.01.11 (7-10-2006)
Added a Pause/Play/Step control panel.
Moved the charges from the centerline of a capacitor, when there is only 1 column of charges.
Bugfix: Stopwatch was intercepting mouse events (even when disabled).

3.01.10 (7-10-2006) 
Added 'Amps' units to current readout.

3.01.09 (7-10-2006)
Improved graphics for lower resolution.
Bugfix: Text for stopwatch is broken.

3.01.08 (7-9-2006)
Strip charts show a gap in the data when not taking data.
Inductors auto-discharge when not in a loop.
Capacitors
    Capacitor charges are be blue for negative, red for positive.
    Square plates are 3d
    Area is a function of capacitance.
Bugfix: In-circuit ammeter fails to move off the toolbar correctly.

3.01.07 (7-7-2006)
Improved graphics for the voltage strip chart.
Strip charts start reading from the right.
Strip charts maintain the correct time-range.

3.01.06 (7-7-2006)
Charts can now be removed.
Bugfix: Charts don't show any data, when first data points are out of range.
Bugfix: Time-series charts looked non-smooth for simple AC RC circuit
>>We can no longer have simulation time dynamic because it destroys smoothness of the plots; converted to static.
Added x and y axis labels for the stripcharts.
Added the Voltage chart: a 2-terminal version of the current meter.
Added a timer.

3.01.05 (7-5-2006)
Bugfix: When you charge a capacitor and completely disconnect if, the capacitor loses all its charge.
Added readout for inductors.
Added component editor for inductors.
Bugfix: 'Advanced' border title disappears on control panel when expanding the advanced panel.
Added schematic view for inductors.
Increased spacing between buttons at the bottom of CCK control panel.
Add a per-component menu item for clearing capacitors & inductors?

Added a floating graph components for reading current.
Added inductors.

Version 3.01.02 (6-22-2006)
Added charge and current graphics for capacitors.
Bugfix: There is some text near the top left of the screen; we can see the descenders dropping down.
Added schematic ac graphic

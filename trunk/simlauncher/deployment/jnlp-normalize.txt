This document describes how to normalize all the jnlp files in a directory (e.g., the simulations directory) so
that SimLauncher works properly with them.

first make a backup:

  tar -cpf /my/files/backup.tar `find /my/files -name \*jnlp\*`

make sure your backup tar file contains the files it should contain:

  tar -tf /my/files/backup.tar

double check by extracting the tar file somewhere else:

  mkdir /tmp/test
  tar -xvpf /my/files/backup.tar

/tmp/test should contain all of your jnlp files in their original
directory structure. if not, don't proceed. :)

now run the sed script that normalizes the jnlp files:


$ sh -c 'for file in `find simulations -name \*.jnlp\*` ; do sed -f set-codebase.sed ${file} > jnlp ; mv -f jnlp ${file} ; done'

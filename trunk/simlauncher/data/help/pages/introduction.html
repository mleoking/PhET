<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>PhET SimLauncher is a program for installing, running, and managing PhET simulations on your own computer. With it, you can install individual simulations when you need them and remove them when you no longer do. Since individual simulations are relatively small in size, installation is usually quick. </p>
<p>Once you've installed a simulation with PhET SimLauncher, you can run it any time, whether you are connected to the internet or not. </p>
<p>Whenever your computer is connected to the internet, you can also quickly check to see if updates are available for any of the simulations you currently have installed, or if there are new simulations available. </p>

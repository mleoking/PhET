<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>
<h2>Hiding and showing thumbnail graphics </h2>
<p>You can hide or show the simulations' thumbnails graphics on either the <em>My Sims</em> or <em>Add/Remove/Update Sims</em> pane by clearing or checking the <em>Show Tumbnails</em> checkbox at the bottom right of the window.</p>
<h2>Speeding sp simLauncher startup</h2>
<p>When SimLauncher starts, it tries to connect with the PhET server to see if there are any updates available. This can be a time-consuming task in some environments. You can speed up the the startup process by turning this feature off. To do this, clear the <em>Automatically check for updates on startup</em> checkbox in the Options menu.</p>
<h2>Prevent students from installing and removing simulations</h2>
<p>You can allow or disallow certain users, such as students, from installing or removing simulations by controlling their accounts' access to the directory in which SimLauncher stores simulations. The default directory is <code>C:\Program Files\PhET SimLauncher\localRoot</code> on a PC. On a Mac or Linux computer, it is <code>/PhET SimLauncher/localRoot</code>. If you have installed SimLauncher somewhere other than the default directory, the simulations will be in the <code>localRoot</code> directory under the directory you specified. </p>
<p>If you want to prevent certain users from being able to install or remove simulations, deny them write priviledges to that directory. </p>
<h2>If all else fails...</h2>
<p>If you can't get your simulations to launch or SimLauncher is not behaving properly, you can reset the program by choosing &quot;Clear cache&quot; from the File menu. Be advised, however, that this action will uninstall any simulations you have installed. </p>

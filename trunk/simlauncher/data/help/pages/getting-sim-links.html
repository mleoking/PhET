<h1>Getting Links to Sims </h1>
<p>Educators often develop worksheets or presentations in which they would like to insert links that will launch simulations. This requires finding the location of the simulation and getting a URL for it.</p>
<p>PhET SimLauncher installs simulations in the following directory:</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>C:\PhET\sl-local-root\www.colorado.edu\physics\phet\simulations </p>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>/PhET/sl-local-root/www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/simulations</p>
<p>Most simulations have their own directory under this simulations directory. Some simulations are part of a family that has a subdirectory (e.g., Lasers, Discharge Lamps and Photoelectric Effect). These subdirectories hold the launch files for the simulations. The launch files for Java simulations end with <span class="style1">.jnlp</span>, and the launch files for Flash simulations end with <span class="style1">.swf</span>. </p>

Bugs
====
- Thumbnails don't display the first time they come down.
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists
- Change all class and variable names to "Sim" from "Simulation"
- Popup menus aren't always displayed in the right place
- Options are getting saved too many time when thubmnails are turned off

========
Features
========
- Put up "Please wait..." dialog while installing
- check for updates to installer itself
- Check for new versions
- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Application must work properly when offline
- On startup, if there is no catalog and client is offline, let the user know
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?

- Put up progress dialog when installing
- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Categories for installed simulations
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories


================
Done, not posted
================
- Store/retrieve Options
- Alphabetical order for installed simulations
- Right-click > Install doesn't launch
- SimulationList items should not be editable
- Double-click to launch
- Double-click to install, with confirmation dialog
- Uninstall needs to actually delete the SimResource.localFile
- Change "Uninstalled Simulations" to something else (Other Available Simulations?)
- Make tables columns fixed width. That's why the we're getting screen turds on the left

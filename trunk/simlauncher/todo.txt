Features
========
- Alphabetical order for installed simulations
- Change "Uninstalled Simulations" to something else (Other Available Simulations?)
- Put up progress dialog when installing
- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Categories for installed simulations
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.

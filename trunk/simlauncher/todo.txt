Bugs
====
- Not all thumbnails are coming down the first time, if Show Thumbnails isn't selected.
- Fix "Wait while updating" dialog
- Does Simulation.install() need to download the thumbnail?
- MetaData must update its properties when appropriate
- Figure out why John Travoltage bug occured
- If site not available but connection is, the app hangs. Need a timeout on the connection attempt.
- figure out why metadata for jar == null for Band Structures, and check is needed. See Simulation.uninstall()
- put timeout on install
- Sim list doesn't resort if most-recently-used is sort type, and a sim is launched
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists
- three state sorting of columns is not a good thing

- Make SetThumbnailsEnabled action

========
Features
========
- Handle error in catalog XML file better. Save to a temp file before sending to SimFactory
- Better check in SimResource.isCurrent() for local resource is newer than remote one.
- put chache under the install directory
- add Export to Removable Media option
- Check for catalog updates
- Include catalog in distribution, to reduce first-time startup on slow connections.
- When you check for updates on multiple simulations, only put up one dialog for everything
- shorten cache path to "codebase"
- Context menu on Catalog pane should apply to all selected simulations
- Does SimTable need to do isCurrent() check on sim, or can it just ask sim.IsUpdateAvailable()?
- check where UPDATE_ENABLED is checked. It isn't named properly

- combine the popup menu classes
- finish populating the catalog
- Set up so the program itself checks for its own updates.
- Make update checks more configurable so that performance isn't impaired on slow connections. Make
	options persistent.

- Rename InstalledSimsPane.new
- Consolidate InstalledSimsPane and CatalogPane.SimPane
- Make Simulation and SimResource instances of Updatable.

- Update check daemon
- Update check for program itself
- Descriptions
- deployment

- Help

- version number in catalog, and version check

- bold heading for sorted column

- "Downloading catalog" dialog
- restrict height of thumbnails
- add and remove rows from SimTable, rather than recreating


- SimTable: include column header in determining width of column

- Uninstall and update only from the Catalog?
- Add menu option for specifying what gets shown in the catalog, a la Explorer
- Catalog
    - Customize view
- Right-click should also select
- Should be able to force an update.
- "Print all" utility for teachers. (Trish's request)
- Write utility to generate the catalog XML file, rather than parsing it on the fly in SimLauncher. Then SimFactory
would only work with an XML file.
- In PhetWebPage, handle things like "img =" and "img="
- In PhetWebPage, be more careful about using the <a> tag with the JNLP that also has the thumbnail and abstract
- Make CategoryFactory use a PhetWebPage

- Main page is installed sims, catalog is auxilliary window, or slide-out panel with list in it

------------
Deployment
------------
- Installer w/ Launch Anywhere?

- Add option to "show all" or "show sims not installed" for catalog simulations.
- Add "Go online" menu item
- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?
- Display abstracts - installing description needs to be debugged

- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories

=======
Testing
=======
- Test update check for all SimResource types
- Do extensive offline testing


=======
0.00.08
=======
- Remove all items from InstalledSimsPopupMenu except for Launch
- When a single simulation sees it has an update available, the whole sim table gets rebuilt. Only the
    row with the data for the simulation should get updated.

=======
0.00.07
=======
- About dialog
- Improved performance when checking for updates.
- Added catagory list to the istalled sims panel
- Added "Update Options" menu so users can tell the launcher whether to check for updates on startup or not, and
    the user can ask to have all installed sims checked for updates.
- Options are persistent
- Installed Simulations pane has a category list
- Put "All Simulations" at the top of the category lists
- Add startup message that tells the user what's going on when the catalog is first being set up, as
	this can take some time if you're not on a pretty fast connection.
- Made clicking on an item in the catalog select/deselect check box.


=======
0.00.06
=======

=======
0.00.05
=======
- Added better handling of being online and offline.
- Fixed some layout problems

=======
0.00.04

- Added checkbox to catalog table for selecting simulations on which to take action. Turned off multiple interval selection mode.
- Replace text with icons for "Installed?" and "Update Available?" columns.

================
0.00.03
================
- Better mechanism for specifying which columns are displayed
- Icons for "Update Available?"
- Catalog
    - Make multiple selections
    - Sort-by headers
- Change "Uninstalled sims" to "Catalog"
- Launch Flash sims
- Thumbnails don't display the first time they come down.
- Multiple selections in catalog
- Moving Man doesn't launch. SmoothMetal shows up as corrupted.
- Flash sims don't sort my most-recently-used
- Changed name of "Unistalled Sims" pane to "Catalog", and include all simulations in it
- Simulation tables are sortable by their headers


=======
0.00.02
=======
- Maximize frame doesn't enlarge the table
- Encapsulate PhetConnection
- On startup, if there is no catalog and client is offline, let the user know
- Application must work properly when offline
- double click launches twice
- Check for new versions
- installed sims popup menu needs to respond to being offline

=======
0.00.01
=======
- Put up progress dialog when installing
- Store/retrieve Options
- Alphabetical order for installed simulations
- Right-click > Install doesn't launch
- SimulationList items should not be editable
- Double-click to launch
- Double-click to install, with confirmation dialog
- Uninstall needs to actually delete the SimResource.localFile
- Change "Uninstalled Simulations" to something else (Other Available Simulations?)
- Make tables columns fixed width. That's why the we're getting screen turds on the left
- Change all class and variable names to "Sim" from "Simulation"
- Popup menus aren't always displayed in the right place


==========
Bugs fixed
==========
7/20-06 - Install both Flash sims, then uninstall them from the Installed Sims pane, and one of them still has
    a check mark in the catalog.
7/20-06 - When multiple sims are installed, exceptions are thrown
7/20-06 - Catalog: Select All, then right click throws exception

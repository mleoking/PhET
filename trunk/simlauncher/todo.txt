Bugs
====
- When you Select All and Remove, things still show up with checks in the Installed? column.
- Balloons and Static Electricity has trouble with SmoothMetal
- Fix "Wait while updating" dialog
- Does Simulation.install() need to download the thumbnail?
- MetaData must update its properties when appropriate
- Figure out why John Travoltage bug occured
- If site not available but connection is, the app hangs. Need a timeout on the connection attempt.
- figure out why metadata for jar == null for Band Structures, and check is needed. See Simulation.uninstall()
- put timeout on install
- Sim list doesn't resort if most-recently-used is sort type, and a sim is launched
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists
- three state sorting of columns is not a good thing

========
Features
========
- Table columns should be resizable
- When the catalog table gets rebuilt, the sort should stay the same
- After sims are installed and the catalog panel updates, keep the same category selected. Right
    now, things go to the All Simulations category
- Better check in SimResource.isCurrent() for local resource is newer than remote one.
- add Export to Removable Media option
- Check for catalog updates
- Include catalog in distribution, to reduce first-time startup on slow connections.
- When you check for updates on multiple simulations, only put up one dialog for everything
- shorten cache path to "codebase"

- Does SimTable need to do isCurrent() check on sim, or can it just ask sim.IsUpdateAvailable()?

- check where UPDATE_ENABLED is checked. It isn't named properly
- Handle error in catalog XML file better. Save to a temp file before sending to SimFactory
- combine the popup menu classes
- Set up so the program itself checks for its own updates.
- Make update checks more configurable so that performance isn't impaired on slow connections. Make
	options persistent.


- Make SetThumbnailsEnabled action
- Rename InstalledSimsPane.new
- Consolidate InstalledSimsPane and CatalogPane.SimPane
- Make Simulation and SimResource instances of Updatable.

- Update check daemon
- Update check for program itself
- Descriptions
- deployment

- Help

- version number in catalog, and version check

- bold heading for sorted column

- "Downloading catalog" dialog
- restrict height of thumbnails
- add and remove rows from SimTable, rather than recreating


- SimTable: include column header in determining width of column

- Uninstall and update only from the Catalog?
- Add menu option for specifying what gets shown in the catalog, a la Explorer
- Catalog
    - Customize view
- Right-click should also select
- Should be able to force an update.
- "Print all" utility for teachers. (Trish's request)
- Write utility to generate the catalog XML file, rather than parsing it on the fly in SimLauncher. Then SimFactory
would only work with an XML file.
- In PhetWebPage, handle things like "img =" and "img="
- In PhetWebPage, be more careful about using the <a> tag with the JNLP that also has the thumbnail and abstract
- Make CategoryFactory use a PhetWebPage

- Main page is installed sims, catalog is auxilliary window, or slide-out panel with list in it

------------
Deployment
------------
- Installer w/ Launch Anywhere?

- Add option to "show all" or "show sims not installed" for catalog simulations.
- Add "Go online" menu item
- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?
- Display abstracts - installing description needs to be debugged

- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories

=======
Testing
=======
- Test update check for all SimResource types
- Do extensive offline testing
- Launch everything in the catalog

=======
0.00.08
=======
- Build installer
- "Check for Updates" button on Add/Remove/Update panel
- Names of panels are "My Sims" and "Add/Remove/Update Sims"
- "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons on "Add/Remove/Update Sims" panel
- Catalog is checked for updates when sims are checked, or when user explicitly asks for check.
- Context menu on Catalog pane should apply to all selected simulations
- finish populating the catalog
- Remove all items from "My Simulations" panel except the name and thumbnail
- Remove all items from InstalledSimsPopupMenu except for Launch
- When a single simulation sees it has an update available, the whole sim table gets rebuilt. Only the
    row with the data for the simulation should get updated.
- Cache is under the directory in which the program is installed. This will make transporting it easier
- Several bugs fixed
- Dialogs come up relative to the Frame
- Make sure categories get updated when the catalog updates during a session

=======
0.00.07
=======
- About dialog
- Improved performance when checking for updates.
- Added catagory list to the istalled sims panel
- Added "Update Options" menu so users can tell the launcher whether to check for updates on startup or not, and
    the user can ask to have all installed sims checked for updates.
- Options are persistent
- Installed Simulations pane has a category list
- Put "All Simulations" at the top of the category lists
- Add startup message that tells the user what's going on when the catalog is first being set up, as
	this can take some time if you're not on a pretty fast connection.
- Made clicking on an item in the catalog select/deselect check box.

- Check for new versions
- installed sims popup menu needs to respond to being offline

=======
0.00.01

Bugs
====
- If site not available but connection is, the app hangs. Need a timeout on the connection attempt.
- If connected to net, the app always checks for updates on startup

- figure out why metadata for jar == null for Band Structures, and check is needed. See Simulation.uninstall()
- put timeout on install

- Sim list doesn't resort if most-recently-used is sort type, and a sim is launched

- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists

- three state sorting of columns is not a good thing

- Make SetThumbnailsEnabled action
- Fix Options persistence
- Options are getting saved too many time when thubmnails are turned off

========
Features
========
- Categories for installed sims, and an associate option
- "Check all for updates"
- Update check daemon
- Update check for program itself
- Descriptions
- deployment

- About dialog
- Help

- persistent options
- version number in catalog, and version check

- bold heading for sorted column

- "Downloading catalog" dialog
- restrict height of thumbnails
- add and remove rows from SimTable, rather than recreating


- SimTable: include column header in determining width of column

- Uninstall and update only from the Catalog?
- Add menu option for specifying what gets shown in the catalog, a la Explorer
- Catalog
    - Customize view
- Right-click should also select
- Should be able to force an update.
- "Print all" utility for teachers. (Trish's request)
- Write utility to generate the catalog XML file, rather than parsing it on the fly in SimLauncher. Then SimFactory
would only work with an XML file.
- In PhetWebPage, handle things like "img =" and "img="
- In PhetWebPage, be more careful about using the <a> tag with the JNLP that also has the thumbnail and abstract
- Make CategoryFactory use a PhetWebPage

- Main page is installed sims, catalog is auxilliary window, or slide-out panel with list in it

------------
Deployment
------------
- Installer w/ Launch Anywhere?

- Add option to "show all" or "show sims not installed" for catalog simulations.
- Add "Go online" menu item
- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?
- Display abstracts - installing description needs to be debugged

- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Categories for installed simulations
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories

=======
Testing
=======
- Test update check for all SimResource types
- Do extensive offline testing

================
Done not posted
================
- build for java 1.4
- Icons in "Is Installed?" and "Udate Available?" columns
- Check boxes next to each row in catalog

================
0.00.03
================
- Better mechanism for specifying which columns are displayed
- Icons for "Update Available?"
- Catalog
    - Make multiple selections
    - Sort-by headers
- Change "Uninstalled sims" to "Catalog"
- Launch Flash sims
- Thumbnails don't display the first time they come down.
- Multiple selections in catalog
- Moving Man doesn't launch. SmoothMetal shows up as corrupted.
- Flash sims don't sort my most-recently-used
- Changed name of "Unistalled Sims" pane to "Catalog", and include all simulations in it
- Simulation tables are sortable by their headers


=======
0.00.02
=======
- Maximize frame doesn't enlarge the table
- Encapsulate PhetConnection
- On startup, if there is no catalog and client is offline, let the user know
- Application must work properly when offline
- double click launches twice
- Check for new versions
- installed sims popup menu needs to respond to being offline

=======
0.00.01
=======
- Put up progress dialog when installing
- Store/retrieve Options
- Alphabetical order for installed simulations
- Right-click > Install doesn't launch
- SimulationList items should not be editable
- Double-click to launch
- Double-click to install, with confirmation dialog
- Uninstall needs to actually delete the SimResource.localFile
- Change "Uninstalled Simulations" to something else (Other Available Simulations?)
- Make tables columns fixed width. That's why the we're getting screen turds on the left
- Change all class and variable names to "Sim" from "Simulation"
- Popup menus aren't always displayed in the right place

- If you remove a sim that is in the category currently selected in the My Sims pane, then go to the My Sims pane,
    the selected category in the My Sims pane will be All Simulations, even though the previously selected
    category is showing in Simulations side of the pane.
- My Sims needs to track the current category.
- Moving Man, older versin needs to be added to the Motion category
- Connect to Phet site drops and reconnects as times (user is alerted).
- New Simulations category doesn't have CCK AC / virtual lab
- If you install a number of simulations at one time, some can then show up as not current
- When started with auot update on and there's a new catalog, the catalog is downloaded, but the
    "check for catalog update" still shows there's an update available. When you do update, the
    subsequent check is correct (catalog is current).
- When Auto Update is on, only the "All sims" category comes up (not repeatable)
- Hung on Check for Updates when all Flash sims in Motion were installed and selected
- Installing all New Simulations, program appeared to hang. Got "local timestamp newer than remote timestamp"
- When installing a list of sims, "Sim already up to date" shows up. Happens when you install all "Top Simulations",
    followed by all "New Simulations"
- Fix "Wait while updating" dialog
- Does Simulation.install() need to download the thumbnail?
- MetaData must update its properties when appropriate
- Figure out why John Travoltage bug occured
- If site not available but connection is, the app hangs. Need a timeout on the connection attempt.
- figure out why metadata for jar == null for Band Structures, and check is needed. See Simulation.uninstall()
- put timeout on install
- Sim list doesn't resort if most-recently-used is sort type, and a sim is launched
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists
- three state sorting of columns is not a good thing

========
Features
========
- Consolidate the CategoryPane classes between MySims and the CatalogPane. Break it out as a separate class
    so it can be used for both tabbed panes.
- Use 16x16 icon for running program icon
- Add dialogs telling the user what's happening during all long operations.
- Add to web site
- If last startup was unsuccessful, don't backup the catalog
- Include Catalog in installer
- Default value for auto updates should be false?, but the first time simlauncher runs, it should check?
- Add Remove button to Actions panel
- Give user option to specify different catalogs
- Set minimum size on panes to be button panels' minimum size
- If you uninstall a sim, does the jws cache still launch it?
- Cache a table for each category on installed sims
- lanching Flash sims puts lots of output to the console
- Don't check for updates every time the category changes if Auto-updates is enabled
- When the catalog is first installing, show a message saying what's going on
- Avoid updateSimTable in the Catalog when status of sims changes.
- Need to be able to cancel installation
- When the catalog table gets rebuilt, the sort should stay the same
- After sims are installed and the catalog panel updates, keep the same category selected. Right
    now, things go to the All Simulations category
- Better check in SimResource.isCurrent() for local resource is newer than remote one.
- add Export to Removable Media option
- Check for catalog updates
- Include catalog in distribution, to reduce first-time startup on slow connections.
- When you check for updates on multiple simulations, only put up one dialog for everything
- shorten cache path to "codebase"

- Does SimTable need to do isCurrent() check on sim, or can it just ask sim.IsUpdateAvailable()?

- check where UPDATE_ENABLED is checked. It isn't named properly
- Handle error in catalog XML file better. Save to a temp file before sending to SimFactory
- combine the popup menu classes
- Set up so the program itself checks for its own updates.
- Make update checks more configurable so that performance isn't impaired on slow connections. Make
	options persistent.


- Make SetThumbnailsEnabled action
- Rename InstalledSimsPane.new
- Consolidate InstalledSimsPane and CatalogPane.SimPane
- Make Simulation and SimResource instances of Updatable.

- Update check daemon
- Update check for program itself
- Descriptions
- deployment

- Help

- version number in catalog, and version check

- bold heading for sorted column
- "Downloading catalog" dialog
- restrict height of thumbnails
- add and remove rows from SimTable, rather than recreating


- SimTable: include column header in determining width of column

- Uninstall and update only from the Catalog?
- Add menu option for specifying what gets shown in the catalog, a la Explorer
- Catalog
    - Customize view
- Right-click should also select
- Should be able to force an update.
- "Print all" utility for teachers. (Trish's request)
- Write utility to generate the catalog XML file, rather than parsing it on the fly in SimLauncher. Then SimFactory
would only work with an XML file.
- Add/Remove/Update as slide-out panel with list in it

------------
Deployment
------------
- Add "Go online" menu item
- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?
- Display abstracts - installing description needs to be debugged

- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories

=======
Testing
=======
- Test update check for all SimResource types
- Do extensive offline testing
- Launch everything in the catalog
- Uninstall multiple sims
- Select All in All Sims category and then Install
- Test updating on a simulation that's in several categories.
- Test update check for each type of SimResource
- Test for updated catalog


=======
0.00.09
=======
- Update availability is accurate for simulations that are in multiple categories, and is updated
    properly in all categories.
- Flash sims uninstall properly
- Performance improved when a lot of simulations are installed
- Catalog is complete and verified
- backup of catalog file made on startup
- Table columns should be resizable
- Switching between categories when there are a lot of installed sims is very slow when Automatic Updates is enabled.
- Items in Simulation menu enable/disable properly when items are selected/deselected.
- Catalog update check and update action provided. Catalog is checked on startup when Auto-update is set on.

=======

- When a single simulation sees it has an update available, the whole sim table gets rebuilt. Only the
    row with the data for the simulation should get updated.
- Cache is under the directory in which the program is installed. This will make transporting it easier
- Several bugs fixed
- Dialogs come up relative to the Frame
- Make sure categories get updated when the catalog updates during a session

=======
- About dialog
- Improved performance when checking for updates.

- Options are persistent
- Installed Simulations pane has a category list
- Put "All Simulations" at the top of the category lists
- Add startup message that tells the user what's going on when the catalog is first being set up, as

=================

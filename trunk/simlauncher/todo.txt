Bugs
====
- Thumbnails don't display the first time they come down.
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists
- Options are getting saved too many time when thubmnails are turned off
- Moving Man doesn't launch. SmoothMetal shows up as corrupted.

========
Features
========
- In PhetWebPage, handle things like "img =" and "img="
- In PhetWebPage, be more careful about using the <a> tag with the JNLP that also has the thumbnail and abstract

- Make the Configuration a resource
- Add option to "show all" or "show sims not installed" for uninstalled simulations.
- Add "Go online" menu item
- Handle Flash sims
- check for updates to installer itself
- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?
- Display abstracts - installing description needs to be debugged

- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Categories for installed simulations
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories

=======
Testing
=======
- Test update check for all SimResource types
- Do extensive offline testing

Done, not posted

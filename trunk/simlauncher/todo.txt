Bugs
====
- Thumbnails don't display the first time they come down.
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists
- Options are getting saved too many time when thubmnails are turned off
- Moving Man doesn't launch. SmoothMetal shows up as corrupted.
- Getting wrong icons in SimSpecs.

========
Features
========
- Right-click should also select
- Should be able to force an update.
- "Print all" utility for teachers. (Trish's request)
- Write utility to generate the catalog XML file, rather than parsing it on the fly in SimLauncher. Then SimFactory
would only work with an XML file.
- In PhetWebPage, handle things like "img =" and "img="
- In PhetWebPage, be more careful about using the <a> tag with the JNLP that also has the thumbnail and abstract
- Make CategoryFactory use a PhetWebPage
- Categorize installed simulations

- Main page is installed sims, catalog is auxilliary window, or slide-out panel with list in it

------------
Deployment
------------
- Installer w/ Launch Anywhere?


- Make the Configuration a resource
- Add option to "show all" or "show sims not installed" for uninstalled simulations.
- Add "Go online" menu item
- Handle Flash sims
- check for updates to installer itself
- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?
- Display abstracts - installing description needs to be debugged

- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Categories for installed simulations
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories

=======
Testing
=======
- Test update check for all SimResource types
- Do extensive offline testing

================
Done, not posted
================

=======
0.00.02
=======
- Maximize frame doesn't enlarge the table
- Encapsulate PhetConnection
- On startup, if there is no catalog and client is offline, let the user know
- Application must work properly when offline
- double click launches twice
- Check for new versions
- installed sims popup menu needs to respond to being offline

=======
0.00.01
=======
- Put up progress dialog when installing
- Store/retrieve Options
- Alphabetical order for installed simulations
- Right-click > Install doesn't launch
- SimulationList items should not be editable
- Double-click to launch
- Double-click to install, with confirmation dialog
- Uninstall needs to actually delete the SimResource.localFile
- Change "Uninstalled Simulations" to something else (Other Available Simulations?)
- Make tables columns fixed width. That's why the we're getting screen turds on the left
- Change all class and variable names to "Sim" from "Simulation"
- Popup menus aren't always displayed in the right place

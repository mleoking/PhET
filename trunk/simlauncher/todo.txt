Bugs

- Thumbnails don't display the first time they come down.
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists

========
Features
========
- Work on Catalog. Move Configuration.getInstalledSimulations() behavior to the Catalog
- Application must work properly when offline
- Uninstall needs to actually delete the SimResource.localFile

- Alphabetical order for installed simulations
- Change "Uninstalled Simulations" to something else (Other Available Simulations?)
- Put up progress dialog when installing
- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Categories for installed simulations

- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories


================
Done, not posted
================
- Right-click > Install doesn't launch

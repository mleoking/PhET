Bugs
====
- Put the cache uder the ProgramFiles directory
- No Launch option for Simulation menu from Catalog pane
- PhET and data directories are getting made under sl-local-root
- Attempt to download from the PhET site happens before the startupNotices are checked. This means that if the URL
    is wrong, the program hangs
- Connect to Phet site drops and reconnects as times (user is alerted).
- Hung on Check for Updates when all Flash sims in Motion were installed and selected
- Installing all New Simulations, program appeared to hang. Got "local timestamp newer than remote timestamp"
- Fix "Wait while updating" dialog
- Does Simulation.install() need to download the thumbnail?
- MetaData must update its properties when appropriate
- Figure out why John Travoltage bug occured
- If site not available but connection is, the app hangs. Need a timeout on the connection attempt.
- figure out why metadata for jar == null for Band Structures, and check is needed. See Simulation.uninstall()
- put timeout on install
- Sim list doesn't resort if most-recently-used is sort type, and a sim is launched
- Clearing the cache doesn't update the installed and available sims lists
- three state sorting of columns is not a good thing

======================
Internal Design Issues
======================
- Too many listeners in SimulationMenu. Too many listener types for TopLevelPane
- Auto-update shouldn't be true by default, but if there is no catalog, an update must be done
- put text labels in the actions themselves
- make singleton Actions and use them to enable/disable controls
- SimTable probably doesn't need to getSelection() and getSelections() to be public
- Clean up the StopDownload mechanism
- Figure out way to put reference count on JarResources so that we can know when to delete them on an uninstall
- If URL for site is bad, stop elegantly
- Consolidate the CategoryPane classes between MySims and the CatalogPane. Break it out as a separate class
    so it can be used for both tabbed panes.
- Cache a table for each category on installed sims
- Launching Flash sims puts lots of output to the console
- Avoid updateSimTable in the Catalog when status of sims changes.
- Better check in SimResource.isCurrent() for local resource is newer than remote one.
- shorten cache path to "codebase"
- Does SimTable need to do isCurrent() check on sim, or can it just ask sim.IsUpdateAvailable()?
- check where UPDATE_ENABLED is checked. It isn't named properly
- Handle error in catalog XML file better. Save to a temp file before sending to SimFactory
- combine the popup menu classes
- Make SetThumbnailsEnabled action
- Rename InstalledSimsPane.new
- Consolidate InstalledSimsPane and CatalogPane.SimPane
- Make Simulation and SimResource instances of Updatable.
- Update check daemon
- version number in catalog, and version check
- add and remove rows from SimTable, rather than recreating
- If you uninstall a sim, does the jws cache still launch it?

========
Features
========
- Installer: figure out how to recommend no VM if one exists on target machine
- make Select column fixed width. Center the header title
- If a local resource is newer, ask the user if he would like to overwrite it anyway.
- Make font on borders around splitPane components bigger
- Add "Go online" menu item
- Add dialogs telling the user what's happening during all long operations.
- If last startup was unsuccessful, don't backup the catalog
- Include Catalog in installer
- Default value for auto updates should be false?, but the first time simlauncher runs, it should check?
- Add Remove button to Actions panel
- Give user option to specify different catalogs
- Set minimum size on panes to be button panels' minimum size
- Don't check for updates every time the category changes if Auto-updates is enabled
- When the catalog is first installing, show a message saying what's going on
- When the catalog table gets rebuilt, the sort should stay the same
- add Export to Removable Media option
- Include catalog in distribution, to reduce first-time startup on slow connections.
- Set up so the program itself checks for its own updates.
- Make update checks more configurable so that performance isn't impaired on slow connections.

- Update check for program itself
- Descriptions
- Help
- bold heading for sorted column
- "Downloading catalog" dialog
- restrict height of thumbnails
- SimTable: include column header in determining width of column
- Add menu option for specifying what gets shown in the catalog, a la Explorer
- Catalog
    - Customize view
- Right-click should also select
- Should be able to force an update.
- "Print all" utility for teachers. (Trish's request)
- Write utility to generate the catalog XML file, rather than parsing it on the fly in SimLauncher. Then SimFactory
would only work with an XML file.
- Add/Remove/Update as slide-out panel with list in it

- CatalogResource should be stored above the cache
- Sync catalog on startup. If simulations that are installed are no longer in the catalog, what should we do?
- Display abstracts - installing description needs to be debugged

- Add a way to get activities from the database for a simulation
- Don't want to sort by update date. This would require too much network overhead every time you start the app.
- Putting up a table that can be sorted by different columns would look odd when a simulation belongs to several different categories


=======
0.01.01
=======
8/06/06 - Once a simtable has been built for a category, changing "show thumbnails" state in another category doesn't
    change the state in the first category

=======
0.01.00
=======

=======
0.00.12
=======
- Add dialog telling the user what's happening while updates are being checked for
- Use 16x16 icon for running program icon
- (fixed) "Check for update to catalog" doesn't seem to work when Auto updates is off
- (fixed) When started with auto update on and there's a new catalog, the catalog is downloaded, but the
    "check for catalog update" still shows there's an update available. When you do update, the
    subsequent check is correct (catalog is current).
- (fixed) Make Installing... dialog a fixed width
- (fixed) The Simulation menu isn't enabling/disabling when items in the catalog pane are checked/unchecked
- (fixed) When nothing is installed on a particular catalog pane, then you install some things, the Check For Updates
    button should become enabled, but it doesn't
- (fixed) When catalog updates, the current list in the sim table of the Catalog pane doesn't update
- (fixed) Moving Man, older versin needs to be added to the Motion category
- (fixed) New Simulations category doesn't have CCK AC / virtual lab

=======
0.00.11
=======
- Added checks for corrupt sim resources that can occur if program is killed while installing a sim. There is code
    to repair things and to instruct the user what to do.
- Better user interaction when Install/Update is clicked on a number of simulations that need to be installed and
    to be updated.

=======
0.00.10
=======
- Add to web site
- Installs can be cancelled while in progress.
- "Installing..." dialog now displays the name of the simulation being installed.
- Connectivity check tries 5 times before it concludes that there is no connection to the PhET web site. This should
    reduce spurious reports to the user that the connection has been lost.
- When installing, the message dialog tells the user which simulation is being installed at the moment.
- After sims are installed and the catalog panel updates, keep the same category selected. Right
    now, things go to the All Simulations category

Internal Features
=================
7/22/06 - When uninstalling a sim, delete everything in its directory, and the directory
7/22/06 - when a sim is asked isCurrent() it does an expensive check. Is there a way for sims to cache that info?
7/22/06 - Cache a table for each category on catalog panel

7/23/06 - If you remove a sim that is in the category currently selected in the My Sims pane, then go to the My Sims pane,
    the selected category in the My Sims pane will be All Simulations, even though the previously selected
    category is showing in Simulations side of the pane.
7/23/06 - My Sims needs to track the current category.

"To Do" list for "Quantum Tunneling" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

DESIGN ISSUES:
- is it OK that barrier width value is not displayed anywhere?
- do we need to show value as drag handles are moved?
- do we need a way to relocate barriers without moving each edge individually?


HIGH PRIORITY:
- add all canvas graphics to the screen instead of world
- add "Restart" button to clock controls
- add time display to lower left of PhetFrame
- resolve open design issues
- design and implement the model
- resolve several phetcommon/Piccolo integration issues
- figure out how to keep the play area filled using Piccolo
- implement graphs using JFreeChart
- create a wrapper around JFreeChart
- determine the best way to add support for complex numbers
- change time to ns when the time values grows too large to display fs
- implement Schrodinger's equation for 1 dimension

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- add application description to SimStrings files
- Save/Load

LOW PRIORITY:
- add build number to "About" dialog
- add PhET logo to "About" dialog


NEW FEATURES:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setIgnoreMouse


CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors


PHETCOMMON:
- create a piccolo version of HelpManager
- factor an interface out of Module and PiccoloModule
- factor an interface out of ApparatusPanel and PiccoloApparatusPanel
- add help support to PiccoloModule

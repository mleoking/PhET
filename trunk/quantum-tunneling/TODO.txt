"To Do" list for "Quantum Tunneling" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- implement algorithm for choosing wave packet position when "Measure" button is pressed
- fix discontinuity in PathRenderer or get rid of it
- set QTConstants.RICHARDSON_STEPS_PER_CLOCK_TICK to something reasonable
- split JFreeCharts into separate charts for plots and backgrounds (if it proves worth the trouble)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- put color legend next to view checkboxes
- move "Show values" from Options menu to control panel
- redo total energy display for wave packets
- fix dt in SchrodingerSolver so that it is related to clock dt
- add application description to SimStrings files
- pause clock while dragging sliders/handles, restore the clock state on release

LOW PRIORITY:
- Help items
- make "about" menu item in HelpMenu accessible so that a different About dialog can be attached
- make Configure dialog smarter about enabling Apply button (compare with original model values)
- select entire spinner value when it gets focus
- fix tab order in Configure dialog
- Wiggle Me
- change time to ns when the time values grows too large to display fs
- add build number to "About" dialog
- add PhET logo to "About" dialog
- translate Yes/No/Cancel on JOptionPane.showConfirmMessage

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- remove test-src
- reduce the range of energy; smaller (E-V) means we can use a larger x-axis step
- disable chart gridlines to improve drag handle responsiveness
- draw chart backgrounds into an image using JFreeChart, the render dynamic stuff using JFreeChart with no decorations
- flatten static elements
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive graphics

CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

PHETCOMMON:
- create a piccolo version of HelpManager
- factor an interface out of Module and PiccoloModule
- factor an interface out of ApparatusPanel and PiccoloApparatusPanel
- add help support to PiccoloModule

JFREECHART:
- CombinedDomainXYPlot.addDomainMarker doesn't do anything
- XYTextAnnotation doesn't support HTML
- AbstractRenderer.getSeriesVisible can return null, isn't properly initialized
- visibilty methods for renderers is a mess

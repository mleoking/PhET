"To Do" list for "Quantum Tunneling" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- debug closed-form solutions for double barrier potentials
- implement phase view
- should wave packet width & center sliders only update model when slider is released?

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- implement Schrodinger's equation for 1 dimension
- add application description to SimStrings files
- Save/Load
- Help items
- hook up Loop button

LOW PRIORITY:
- loop button should be disabled for plane wave
- make Configure dialog smarter about enabling Apply button (compare with original model values)
- select entire spinner value when it gets focus
- fix tab order in Configure dialog
- Wiggle Me
- change time to ns when the time values grows too large to display fs
- add build number to "About" dialog
- add PhET logo to "About" dialog
- translate Yes/No/Cancel on JOptionPane.showConfirmMessage

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- remove test-src
- convert JFreeCharts to static images and implement custom plotting on top images
- reduce the range of energy; smaller (E-V) means we can use a larger x-axis step
- disable chart gridlines to improve drag handle responsiveness
- draw chart backgrounds into an image using JFreeChart, the render dynamic stuff using JFreeChart with no decorations
- flatten static elements
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive graphics

CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

PHETCOMMON:
- create a piccolo version of HelpManager
- factor an interface out of Module and PiccoloModule
- factor an interface out of ApparatusPanel and PiccoloApparatusPanel
- add help support to PiccoloModule

JFREECHART:
- CombinedDomainXYPlot.addDomainMarker doesn't do anything
- ChartRenderingInfo.setDataArea and getArea are obsolete
- XYTextAnnotation doesn't support HTML

- position beam graphics from the beam origin
- AtomGraphic should just be a listener, not a SimpleObserver
- Photons jump to right when stimulated emissoin happens
- Put off..max labels on intensity slider
- color control under the lamp, intensity on top
- Make colors of energy levels map to real values
- Prevent energy levels from being dragged past each other


- AtomicState lifetime manager should be part of the base AtomicState now. There is no need of a separate
SpontaneouslyEmittingState.
- Memory leak in multiple atom panel
- Enable photons emitted on high-to-mid state transitions
- add CollimatedBeamGraphic, or CollimatedBeamView class
- Change interpolation method that creates middle and high energy atom graphics.
- spontaneousEmmisionHalfLife and SpontaneousEmissionTime methods are confusing
- Line 34 in GroundState has a call that has terrible style
- Change location constants in BaseLaserModule to key off location of laser instead of s_origin

- Debug library, with ClockControlPanel
Should we keep or toss TxTranslatable, TxGraphic, TxBoundary, if we keep, can we conglomerate?

Refactor ModelViewTx2D and AffineTxUtil

=========================================================
- Changed AtomGraphic to be an EventListener from a SimpleObserver
- Beam control panels change if the rate of the beam changes
- Lenses of lamps are the same as the photons they produce
- Make colors of energy levels map to real values
- Prevent energy levels from being dragged past each other
- photon energy must match the energy state energy to push an atom to a particular energy state
- Put wavelength control on the flashlight
- Energy states are represented by colored rings around atoms of a color associated with the energy level, and a
thickness proportional to the energy above the ground state.
- Make colors of energy levels map to real values
- Made cavity smaller
----------------------------------------------------------
11/9
- Prevent energy levels from being dragged past each other
- Put uncertainty back into state lifetimes
- Increase magnification of middle and high energy states
- Make energy levels mouse-able
    - Make AtomicState classes singletons
- Make state lifetimes dependent on energy level
- Change internal rep of CollimatedBeam to get rid of x,y,width,height and just use the Rectangle2D

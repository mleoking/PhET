- When the app is paused, the dots on the energy levels window doesn't always agree with the laser itself

- State should know if a photon should be emitted when it is left. Currently, the Atom class makes this decision
when theStateLifetimeManager is created.
- SpontaneouslyEmittingState should be refactored to be a StateLifetimeManager
- Reintegrate the mirros into the cavity, rather than having them be separate objects at the module level.
- Photon doesn't use the free pool. Get rid of it.


- EnergyLevelMonitorPanel is an observer of the model. This causes lots of repaints. Instead, it should just be
a AtomicState.PopulationChangeListener, or the EnergyLevelGraphics should be, and the squiggles listen to the beams
- unify use of ModelViewTx1D in EnergyLevelGraphic and EnergyLevelMonitorPanel. The latter should set the transform
and send it to the former.

- AtomGraphic should just be a listener, not a SimpleObserver
- Put off..max labels on intensity slider
- color control under the lamp, intensity on top


- AtomicState lifetime manager should be part of the base AtomicState now. There is no need of a separate
SpontaneouslyEmittingState.
- Enable photons emitted on high-to-mid state transitions
- add CollimatedBeamGraphic, or CollimatedBeamView class
- Change interpolation method that creates middle and high energy atom graphics.
- spontaneousEmmisionHalfLife and SpontaneousEmissionTime methods are confusing
- Line 34 in GroundState has a call that has terrible style
- Change location constants in BaseLaserModule to key off location of laser instead of s_origin

- Debug library, with ClockControlPanel
Should we keep or toss TxTranslatable, TxGraphic, TxBoundary, if we keep, can we conglomerate?

Refactor ModelViewTx2D and AffineTxUtil


=========================================================
12/16/04
- Made mirrors on cavity reflect in both directions
- Reduced max pumping rate on single atom panel by 1/8
- Added controls for the cheat angle and cavity height
- Changed labels on radio buttons to "Upper Transition" and "Lower Transition"

12/15/04
- Removed "(ev)" from y axis label in energy levels window
- When MultipleAtomModule is activated, the number of levels needs to be set to three.


11/16/04
- Removed restriction of method ending in "Occurred" from EventRegistry

---------------------------------------------------------
11/16/04
- position beam graphics from the beam origin
- Changed AtomGraphic to be an EventListener from a SimpleObserver
- Beam control panels change if the rate of the beam changes
- Lenses of lamps are the same as the photons they produce
- Make colors of energy levels map to real values
- Prevent energy levels from being dragged past each other
- photon energy must match the energy state energy to push an atom to a particular energy state
- Put wavelength control on the flashlight
- Energy states are represented by colored rings around atoms of a color associated with the energy level, and a
thickness proportional to the energy above the ground state.
- Make colors of energy levels map to real values
- Made cavity smaller
----------------------------------------------------------
11/9
- Prevent energy levels from being dragged past each other
- Put uncertainty back into state lifetimes
- Increase magnification of middle and high energy states
- Make energy levels mouse-able
    - Make AtomicState classes singletons
- Make state lifetimes dependent on energy level
- Change internal rep of CollimatedBeam to get rid of x,y,width,height and just use the Rectangle2D

To do
=====
near UV photons don't get recorded on the spectrometer

Check for memory leaks, and possible slowdown with lots of photons. Cache them?


both the model and each atom have atomicStates[]. They should only be in one place.

Simulation slows and waits while sliders are being moved

Fix the "currentDisplayFactor" hack in DischargeLampModule and SingleAtomModule

Combine the voltageCalibrationFactor and PIXELS_TO_NM
Get voltageCalibrationFactor out of DischargeLampModule
Counter in spectrometer for off-scale photons

Done
====

-------
Fixed bug in which putting the voltage at 0 while there are electrons in the tube made
all the electrons stop for good

Change label of y axis in energy levels panel

9-12-05
------
sometimes atom doesn't appear in it's level on the monitor panel


9-6-05
------
Number under electron production rate slider need formatting
Atom halos not right on multiple atom panel
Calibrated the voltage
When you switch between hydrogen and the configurable atom, the configurable atom maintains its state
Added label to the spinner for the configurable atom
Hydrogen energy levels aren't movable
Configurable energy levels can be moved within 3 pixels of each other
Fixed problem with multiple electron graphics on the energy monitor panel
Squiggles are on by default on single atom module
"Collision energy" indicator should always show on single atom module
Spectrometer clears every time it is shown
Single electron no longer stimulates atom at level higher than it's collision energy
Spectrometer isn't be movable
Removed neon from atom type selection list
Put scale on the spectrometer
    300-800nm is visible
    left is "far UV", right is "far IR"


9-5-05
------
checkboxes on multiple atom panel are in different place than on single atom panel
Cut legs off the heater filaments
Single-shot works when voltage < 0.
Default simulation speed is half of what it was.
Spectrometer should come up running -
    What do you want to happen when it is hidden and re-shown? Should it continue to run, stop, or reset?
    Add lines to spectrometer showing UV and IR off-scale points. Add photons to these bins.

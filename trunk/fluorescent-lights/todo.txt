Important changes after Photoelectric simulation
--------------------------------------------------

DischargeLampModel.addModelElement().
    Block of code commented out

AtomicStateFactory
    changed computation of energies on line 41, in constructor

DiscahrgeLampModule
    increased max voltage to 5 from 0.1


To do
-----
both the model and each atom have atomicStates[]. They should only be in one place.

Move creation of the tube to the model

When voltage is reversed, produce electrons from right-hand plate

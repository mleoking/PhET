To do
=====
both the model and each atom have atomicStates[]. They should only be in one place.

Photons disappear as soon as they get past the left edge of the ciruit.
Simulation slows and waits while sliders are being moved
Number under electron production rate slider need formatting

Spectrometer
------------
Cut legs off the heater filaments
checkboxes on multiple atom panel are in different place than on single atom panel


Done

------
Single-shot works when voltage < 0.
Default simulation speed is half of what it was.
Spectrometer should come up running -
    What do you want to happen when it is hidden and re-shown? Should it continue to run, stop, or reset?
    Add lines to spectrometer showing UV and IR off-scale points. Add photons to these bins.

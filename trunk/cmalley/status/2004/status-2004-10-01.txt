PERIOD: Wed 9/29/04 - Fri 10/1/04

HOURS: 18.0 (5 + 6 + 7)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  - met with Ron LeMaster for an overview of the PhET software architecture
    and description of the "Color Vision" simulation requirements
  - downloaded PhET software from SourceForge CVS into my IDE (Eclipse),
  - got all necessary PhET software to build in my IDE (this took a bit
    of tweaking, had to work around some platform-specific stuff)
  - began reviewing the structure of a PhET simulation, using the 
    existing "Sound" simulation as an example
  - began writing the "Color Vision" simulation in Java, using the 
    PhET software architecture.  Got the basic framework set up and 
    running (modules and control panels, minimal apparatus).

WHAT'S NEXT:

  - review the existing "Color Vision" Flash implementation
  - begin fleshing out the model and 2D view components in Java

ISSUES:

  - none

Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Status Report

PERIOD: Tue 10/5/04 - Fri 10/8/04

HOURS:  21.5 (6.5 + 5.5 + 4.0 + 5.5)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  - spent 9 hours of my own time learning Flash and Actionscript
    (PhET will not be billed for this)
  - reviewed the existing Flash implementation of Color Vision simulation,
    tried to locate all the "hidden" Actionscript
  - fixed some illegal Actionscript that doesn't compile with Flash MX 2004 v7.2
  - identified potential bottlenecks and optimizations
  - optimized some potentially expensive code based on the Math class
  - optimized the photon-related portions of the Flash implementation,
    including memory management and rendering
  - achieved some performance gains, but not significant enough to be provide 
    acceptable interactivity (response of sliders is still sluggish)
     
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - make a decision early next week (probably Monday) about whether to 
    continue trying to optimize the Flash version of Color Vision, or to 
    resume porting it to Java

ISSUES:

  - none

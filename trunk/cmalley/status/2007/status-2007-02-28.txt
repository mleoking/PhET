Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Feb 22 - Feb 28, 2007 (Thu-Wed)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  SVN migration:
  - participate in discussion about repository structure
  - migrate my development workspace from CVS to SVN
  - re-build and re-test all of my sims
  - run tests with Subclipse SVN client
  - read many Subclipse tutorials, forums, etc.
  - investigate alternatives to Subclipse
  - work around many (all?) Subclipse problems
  
  Optical Tweezers:
  - implemented minor change requests from previous status meeting
  - minor progress, nothing significant to demo
  
  Rutherford Scattering:
  - receive "go ahead" to start this sim
  - did not start, waiting until SVN migration is done

WHAT'S NEXT:
  
  o continue work on Optical Tweezers, see:
    http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/optical-tweezers/TODO.html
    
  o start on Rutherford Scattering sim
  
  o combine Play & Pause clock buttons in my sims?
  
ISSUES:
 
  - SVN migration was much more expensive than expected (15+ hours so far)
  - I don't have a lot of confidence in the Subclipse SVN client
  
DATES UNAVAILABLE:

  - July 16-20
  - August 6-17

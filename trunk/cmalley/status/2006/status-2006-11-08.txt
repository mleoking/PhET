Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Nov 9 - Nov 15, 2006 (Thu-Wed)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Hydrogen Atom:
  - expanded Bohr's 1st orbit and distorted other orbits so they all fit in the box
  - adjusted radius of billiard ball and plum pudding to match Bohr's 1st orbit
  - created other "looks" for plum pudding, decided not to change it
  - implemented Bohr absorption, emission and stimulated emission
  - added Help>Spectral Line Table dialog
  - added developer control for "closeness" required for photon absorption
  - added developer control for "max particles in box" when intensity is 100%
  - reduced memory footprint and garbage collection by caching photon images
  - improved random number generation used in probabilistic algorithms
  - made particles go behind Experiment atom
  - tried to locate spectral line table model in Discharge Lamps sim
  - published 0.00.09
  
WHAT'S NEXT:
  
  o continue work on Hydrogen Atom simulation, see: 
    http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/hydrogen-atom/TODO.html
    
  o publish Bound States 1.02 ?
    
ISSUES:
 
  o none

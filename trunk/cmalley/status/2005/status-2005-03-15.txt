Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Tue 3/8/05 - Mon 3/15/05

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
    
  - worked on Faraday simulation, including:
    o published v0r17
    o first pass at Generator module
    o redid the AC sine wave display
    o calibrated the compass grid, fades to zero much more smoothly
    o electrons now stay horizontally aligned across coil loops 
    o added space between control groups in the control pane
    o workaround for zero AC amplitude exception on Windows & Linux
    o compass stays in its current location when magnet strength goes to zero (no background magnetic field)
    o add tick marks on battery amplitude slider
    o misc internal code changes
      
  - phetcommon work
    o investigated issue with offscreen buffer in ApparatusPanel2 (RGB vs ARGB)
    
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - continue work on Faraday (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/faraday/todo.txt)

ISSUES:

  - I cannot continue with the "Generator" module until I have answers to the questions 
    enumerated at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/faraday/v0r17/

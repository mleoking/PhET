Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Tue 4/5/05 - Tue 4/12/05

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
    
  Faraday simulation:
    o publish v0r21 and v0r22
    o add a resistor & probes to the Voltmeter indicator
    o add wiggle mes or challenges to all modules
    o optimize lightbulb graphic by drawing rays using Graphics.drawLine
    o optimize lightbulb graphic memory allocation
    o add debug code to draw the bounds of the electromagnet model
    o add debug code to display the pickup coil sample points
    o fix coil collision bounds to include the ends of the coil
    o crank up the compass grid rescaling a little so that it fills more of the apparatus panel
    o make "challenges" distinct from "wiggle mes" (different class, different color)
    o make Electromagnet module's wiggle me go away if electromagnet location changes
    o prevent objects from being dragged off the apparatus panel
    o prevent objects from receiving bogus drag events that cause them to move
    o fix sliders do that they always unhighlight when you roll off them
    o change all mouse event handlers to be MouseInputAdapters due to conflict with TranslationListener
    o clean up localization file, remove unused strings

  Fourier simulation:
    o nothing
  
  phetcommon:
    o fix mouse event handling in ApparatusPanel2
    o create an application for testing mouse event handling
    o add setName and getName to PhetGraphic
    
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - continue work on Faraday (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/faraday/todo.txt)

ISSUES:

  - none

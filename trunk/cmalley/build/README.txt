This folder contains Eclipse JAR description (.jardec) files and JAR Manifest files (.mf).
Each simulation project that I've worked on has a .jardesc and a .mf file.
A .jardesc file tells Eclipse how to build a self-contained JAR for the simulation.
A .mf file defines the contents of a simulation's MANIFEST.MF file, and includes 
the CVS tag information and main class information for the simulation.

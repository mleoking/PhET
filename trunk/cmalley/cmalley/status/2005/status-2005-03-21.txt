Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Wed 3/16/05 - Mon 3/21/05

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
    
  - worked on Faraday simulation, including:
    o published v0r18 & v0r19
    o added a cursor that moves across the AC sin wave
    o guarantee that AC hits all peaks and zero-crossing values.
    o flatten all static graphics (optimization)
    o add tick marks around voltmeter display, convert guage to Java shapes
    o fix case where Field Meter displays B=0.00 and a non-zero theta
    o label electromagnet current source choices "DC" and "AC"
    o keep zero-crossing of AC sine wave at origin of the XY axis
    o add an X/Y axis at center of the AC display
    o set low end of AC frequency to 10%
    o add field meter to Transformer & Generator modules
    o finalize requirements for Generator module
    o use icons in control panels for selecting current source and pickup indicator
    o standardize order of controls in Electromagnet and Pickup panels
    o remove rescaler from source coil, shouldn't be rescaled
    o create separate rescalers for lightbulb, voltmeter, electrons and compass grid.
      
  - phetcommon work
    o investigated problems with PhetLookAndFeel and ApparatusPanel2
    
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - continue work on Faraday (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/faraday/todo.txt)

ISSUES:

  - none

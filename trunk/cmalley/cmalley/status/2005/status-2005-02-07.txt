Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Wed 2/2/05 - Mon 2/7/05

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  - worked on Faraday simulation, including:
    o published revisions v0r10, v0r11
    o compute induced emf using average of flux at 3 points (center and 2 edges of coil)
    o performance optimization of "compass grid"
    o added basic support for electron animation (de Caselijau's algorithm)
    o improved "3D" look of coil graphic, adjusted to work with collision detection
    o added background color chooser to Options menu (ala CCK)
    o simplified some of the Developer Controls (magnet size, needle size)
    o lowered the frame rate to 10 fps (performance optimization)
    o converted all model elements to use radians instead of degrees (performance optimization)
    o fixed the Field Meter text field locations (broken by a PhetTextGraphic change)
    o misc internal code changes & optimizations

WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - continue work on Faraday (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/faraday/todo.txt)

ISSUES:

  - none

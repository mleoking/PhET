Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: 6/28/05-7/11/05 (Tue-Mon)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  I was on vacation from July 1-7.
  
  Fourier simulation:
    o misc fixes, code clean up, and javadoc in Discrete module
    o javadoc of Discrete module
    o work on requirements for "Discrete to Continuous" module with Sam M.
    
  phetcommon:
    o created PhetFlattenedGraphic for optimizing rendering of static graphics
    o fix GraphicLayerSet and CompositePhetGraphic to handle ignoreMouse properly
    o provide applications with access to DebugMenu
    o works with Sam R. to fix control panel layout problem with JSliders on Mac

  charts:
    o optimize redraws
    o optimize memory managment of GeneralPaths

WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  o continue work on Fourier (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/fourier/TODO.txt)

ISSUES:

  o I will not be able to attend the status meeting on July 12 due to a conflict.
  o Due to the absence of requirements, the Fourier "Wave Pulse Shaper" will not be available for AAPT.
  o The Fourier "Discrete to Continuous" module design is not feasible in its current form.
  o I need requirements for all Fourier modules before continuing. Without such requirements,
    I cannot write code that is reusable throughout the simulation.

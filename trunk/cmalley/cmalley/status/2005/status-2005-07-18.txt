PERIOD: 7/12/05-7/18/05 (Tue-Mon)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Fourier simulation:
    o fixed animation synchronization problems in the "Discrete" module
    o added control panel to the "Discrete To Continuous" module
    o refactored some code that was getting a bit unwieldy
    o removed the Continuous module
    o published v0r4
    o published a couple of "sandbox" versions
    
  phetcommon:
    o helped Sam R. with piccolo testing on Mac

  charts:
    o tested performance of large numbers of sine plots

WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  o continue work on Fourier (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/fourier/TODO.txt)

ISSUES:

  o I need requirements for the remaining Fourier modules. 
    Without such requirements, I cannot write code that is reusable 
    throughout the simulation.

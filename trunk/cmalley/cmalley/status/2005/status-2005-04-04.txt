Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Wed 3/30/05 - Mon 4/4/05

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
    
  Faraday simulation:
    o calibrated lightbulb, voltmeter and electron animation
    o met with Kathy to review
    o added a lower threhold for lightbulb, voltmeter and electron animation
    o improved compass animation
    o rewrote rescaler for compass grid, deleted all other rescalers
    o fixed calculation of change in flux
    o misc internal code optimizations
   
  Fourier simulation:
    o reviewed Sam M's design, provided feedback
    o set up the basic code framework and checked it into CVS
  
  phetcommon:
    o removed a performance bottleneck from ApparatusPanel2 (minimized calls to AffineTransform.createTransformedShape)
    
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - continue work on Faraday (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/faraday/todo.txt)
  - prototype bits of Fourier design?

ISSUES:

  - none

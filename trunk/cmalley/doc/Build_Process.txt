Here's my process for building and publishing a simulation:

1. edit the eclipse/*.mf file to contain the CVS tag for the release
2. run the eclipse/*.jardesc file from Eclipse to create the unprocessed JAR
3. run the proguard/*.pro file from ProGuard to create the processed JAR
4. scp the processed JAR to spot.colorado.edu
5. move the processed JAR to the proper subdirectory in spot:/htdocs/physics/phet/dev/

Bugs:
If the block is grabbed to start recording, the cursor from playback doesn’t disappear.

To Do:
Add child/sled.
FBD vectors are often too large for the window.
Make FBD optionally appear in a separate window.

Low Priority:
Reduce the total record time?  Slow time down?
This was supposed to address the problem of low horizontal real estate.  I'm not sure how well it succeeds.
Make slider thumb more three-d-er.
Move “frictionless” checkbox inside slider area (2nd panel only).
Striped Arrow coordinate view stripes for perp & parallel?
My technique will be difficult for perp & parallel.  We shall confer about the Cartesian arrow graphics before pursuing.

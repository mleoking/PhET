These are files that can be read into the Schmidt-Lee applet at 
http://fermi.la.asu.edu/Schroedinger/index.html.

There are 1-well files for each of the Bound States well types.

There are 2-well files for Coulomb and Square wells.

The parameters to V(x) in each file are as follows:
offset = offset
d = depth
w = width
s = spacing (separation for square wells)

Mass is assumed to be 1 x electron mass (5.68).

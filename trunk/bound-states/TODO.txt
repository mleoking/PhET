"To Do" list for "Bound States" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- drag handles for each potential type (all slightly different)
- implement Save/Load for model
- existing Save/Load code is broken, throws exception related to BSBottomPlot
- time display and animation pauses every few clock ticks (garbage collection?)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- verify that datasets are updated only when absolutely necessary
- make sure things update properly when clock is paused
- wiggle me animation is jerky
- bug: Energy datasets are drawn on top of mag glass when configuring potential (Mac only?)
- Carl reports a slow down after running the sim for awhile (looking at 3D Coulomb wave function, real + imaginary)
- reduce startup time

LOW PRIORITY:
- bug: top/bottom edge of chart (and plots?) don't line up with center of mag glass lens, worse as mag power increases
- green eigenstate lines have varying brightnesses on Windows
- make plots in bottom chart look smoother on Windows
- refactor BSAbstractModule, it's too big
- refactor other classes that have gotten too big
- wave function curves look segmented when screen resolution is decreased after sim is started
- DoubleSpinner doesn't validate input or fire ChangeEvent when you press Return key
- additional zoom levels for Coulomb
- add BSModel.PROPERTY_POTENTIAL_TYPE to indicate that we're switching potential types
- use a common interface for Schmidt-Lee and analytic solvers, apply strategy pattern to pick one
- move wave function cache out of BSBottomPlot and into model
- cache wave functions used in BSBottomPlot.updateHiliteDataset instead of always calling potential.getWaveFunctionPoints

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive graphics

CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ DEVELOPMENT BEGINS ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


REJECTED:
(6/21/06) - pause clock by default (requirement changed, should be running by default)
(6/21/06) - switch back to FastPathRenderer for curves (doesn't seem to be any faster, stick with StandardXYItemRenderer)
(6/21/06) - rename BSEigenstatesNode to BSEigenstatesManipulatorNode (would lose CVS history)
(6/21/06) - scale position axis to fit excited portion of wavefunction (not necessary)
(6/9/06) - restore WAVE_FUNCTION_RANGE and PROBABILITY_DENSITY_RANGE (Sam likes the new ranges)
(6/7/06) - method of scaling time-dependent wave function doesn't always result in max amplitude=1 over time (we can't solve this)
(6/7/06) - update while sliders are dragging (fine as is, no one has complained)
(6/7/06) - how does the user know the mass in the Two and Many panels? there is no mass control (not intended to be quantitative)
(6/7/06) - different method of solving when multi-wells are spaced far apart? (we don't have this problem)
(6/6/06) - "superposition state presets" feature (difficult to specify, difficult to implement, not essential to learning goals)
(6/6/06) - help items (can't think of any they want)
(6/2/06) - comment out block of normalization code in SchmidtLeeSolver (values got huge, way off the bottom plot scale)
(6/2/06) - scale the magnifying glass when the canvas size changes (not necessary, difficult, see note in BSAbstractModule.layoutCanvas)
(6/2/06) - set initial mag glass osition, centered on lowest "band" of eigenstates shown in Energy chart (hard code it to most likely position)
(5/17/06) - can't hilite or select lower 1D Coulomb eigenstates when zoomed out (cannot reproduce)
(5/17/06) - bug: Coulomb potential curve disappears when coming back to "One Well" module from another module (cannot reproduce)
(5/17/06) - for square & asymmetric wells with height=0, there are no eigenstates; should lower bound of height be non-zero? (no, this is desirable)
(5/16/06) - use 1D Coulomb wave function to display prob density for 3D Coulomb (vetoed by Carl, too much work)
(5/9/06) - stop looking for Coulomb eigenstates when energy > max visible potential (stop after first 10 eigenstates)
(5/9/06) - represent closely-spaced eigenstates as a thicker line (decided on magnifying glass solution)
(5/9/06) - display values of all closely-spaced eigenstates at the same time (decided on magnifying glass solution)
(5/9/06) - investigate overview interface for energy chart (use more/less zoom instead)
(5/9/06) - magnify width of lines thru magnifying glass (makes eigenstates overlap)
(5/9/06) - show chart ticks & gridlines thru magnifying glass (too damn hard, not necessary)
(5/1/06) - disable the superposition button if no eigenstates are found (we should always find states, and superposition dialog works OK if we don't)
(4/26/06) - change superposition equation for Coulomb to include only even eigenstates? (no)
(4/26/06) - make SchmidtLee.getWaveFunction return Point2D[] instead of double[] (wrapped by BSAbstractPotential.getWaveFunctionPoints)
(4/26/06) - square & asymm wells don't have square sides when dx gets larger, override getPotentialPoints for square & asymm (set pixels-per-sample appropriately)
(4/24/06) - don't construct DecimalFormat, use NumberFormat.getInstance (doesn't do what I need)
(4/21/06) - change semantics of spacing (only works for Square wells, where would we put drag handles?)
(4/17/06) - +5 label on Energy y-axis is clipped (fixed itself when I added a bit to range)
(4/14/06) - eigenstate combo box was dropped from the control panel when we decided to show coefficients for all eigenstates

"To Do" list for "Bound States" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:


HIGH PRIORITY:
- have a "config" object for each module that contains ranges, flags, etc.
- implement analytic solution for 3D Coulomb (eigenstates and wave function)
- use analytic solution for single-well 1D Coulomb
- support separate Energy chart y-axis range for each potential type
- change energy range: Coulomb=[-15,+5], others=[-5,+15] (not until offset issue is resolved)
- change definition of offset for Square and Asymmetric, make it bottom of well (not until drag handles issue is resolved)
- support separate offset range for each potential type (not until offset issue is resolved)
- investigate magnifying glass with ability to select/hilite eigenstates
- investigate overview interface for energy chart
- investivate more/less zoom controls
- replace Coulomb 1-D and 3-D eigenstate solver with analytic solution
- bug: Coulomb potential curve disappears when coming back to "One Well" module from another module
- compare everything to Schmidt-Lee applet
- check tick marks on all sliders with new ranges
- some eigenstates are so close together that one or more can't be selected or hilited
- cache wavefunction solutions
- determine the conditions under which Schmidt-Lee solvers fail

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- stopwatch does not run smoothly (garbage collection?)
- add BSModel.PROPERTY_POTENTIAL_TYPE to indicate that we're switching potential types
- drag handles for each potential type (all slightly different)
- implement Save/Load for model
- reduce startup time
- represent closely-spaced eigenstates as a thicker line?
- examine closely-spaced eigenstates using a magnifying glass?
- display values of all closely-spaced eigenstates at the same time?
- pause clock by default
- green eigenstate lines have varying brightnesses on Windows
- verify that datasets are updated only when absolutely necessary
- stop looking for Coulomb eigenstates when energy > max visible potential
- different method of solving when multi-wells are spaced far apart?

LOW PRIORITY:
- update while sliders are dragging
- wave function curves look segmented when screen resolution is decreased after sim is started
- scale position axis to fit excited portion of wavefunction (might not do this)
- remove Harmonic Oscillator and Asymmetric potential choices in Multiple module
- DoubleSpinner doesn't validate input or fire ChangeEvent when you press Return key

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive graphics

CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

REJECTED:

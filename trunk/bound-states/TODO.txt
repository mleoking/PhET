"To Do" list for "Bound States" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- cache wavefunction solutions
- determine the constraints on position range and dx for Schmidt-Lee, when does it fail?

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- make SchmidtLee.getWaveFunction return Point2D[] instead of double[]
- square & asymm wells don't have square sides when dx gets larger (override getPotentialPoints for square & asymm)
- default to Probability Density
- verify that datasets are updated only when absolutely necessary
- drag handles for each potential type (all slightly different)
- disable the superposition button if no eigenstates are found
- implement Save/Load for model
- Single and Double modules need to permanently hide the "number of wells" control
- different width ranges for single, double, many well modules
- use specified defaults for all controls
- update while sliders are dragging
- different method of solving when multi-wells are spaced far apart

LOW PRIORITY:
- scale position axis to fit excited portion of wavefunction (might not do this)
- Spanish translations
- commandline options for choosing which modules to display
- remove Harmonic Oscillator and Asymmetric potential choices in Multiple module
- DoubleSpinner doesn't validate input or fire ChangeEvent when you press Return key

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive graphics

CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

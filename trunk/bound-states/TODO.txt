"To Do" list for "Bound States" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- add an option to show average prob density of a band of eigenstates
- zoom level is not remembered when switching between potential types in Many module

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ DEVELOPMENT BEGINS ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


REJECTED:
(8/1/06) - at fastest clock speed, wave appears to move slower for some configurations; eg, E1 for 1D Coulomb in "Two Wells" (ok as is)
(8/1/06) - parameterize Schmidt-Lee to take variable value for MAX_TRIES (already responsive enough, not worth effort)
(8/1/06) - provide user with feedback when they attempt to drag a handle past its min/max (not necessary)
(8/1/06) - selecting "phase" view causes a big slow down because SCHMIDT_LEE_SAMPLE_POINTS=1350 (not important)
(7/31/06) - wiggle me animation is jerky on some slower machines (seems to be OK now)
(7/31/06) - make plots in bottom chart look smoother on Windows (already as good as it gets)
(7/14/06) - drag handles that use the Schmidt-Lee eigenstate solver are less responsive than analytic solver (nothing I can do about this)
(7/13/06) - get rid of BSModel (impossible at this point, complicated and hugely destabilizing)
(7/13/06) - 2 columns for color scheme dialog (1 skinny column is easier to move out of the way)
(7/12/06) - if exception occurs in drag handle's updateModel method, need to addObserver (not necessary, exception was a bug that was fixed)
(7/12/06) - if exception occurs in drag handle's updateView method, need to addPropertyChangeListener (not necessary, exception was a bug that was fixed)
(7/11/06) - plots and chart edges don't always line up with center of mag glass lens, worse as mag power increases (no one has ever noticed this, hard to fix)
(7/11/06) - make offset drag handles looks "different" (not necessary)
(7/11/06) - some drag handle values get clipped by the chart (OK as is)
(7/3/06) - redraw problem when dragging mag glass in "Many" panel with 1D Coulomb and Help enabled (occurs only on Windows with Java 1.5.0_6)
(6/28/06) - generate images for clock and zoom buttons, delete image files (not worth the effort, would only save 3K)
(6/28/06) - wave function cache could be smarter about saving stuff until the potential or particle have changed (too much work, not enough payoff)
(6/28/06) - used lazy module init to reduce startup time (too much work, no one is complaining about startup time)
(6/28/06) - use a common interface for Schmidt-Lee and analytic solvers, apply strategy pattern to pick one (they are sufficiently different to make this very difficult)
(6/28/06) - move wave function cache out of BSBottomPlot and into BSModel (too big a change, cache needs to know about position range)
(6/28/06) - add BSModel.PROPERTY_POTENTIAL_TYPE to indicate that we're switching potential types (too big a change, no real payoff, would break things at this point)
(6/28/06) - cache wave functions for hilited eigenstate (payoff won't be perceptible)
(6/28/06) - Carl reports a slow down after running the sim for awhile (cannot reproduce, not enough info, lots of changes since this was reported, may have fixed itself)
(6/22/06) - wave function curves look segmented when screen resolution is decreased after sim is started (user must restart sim, no way to detect resolution change)
(6/21/06) - pause clock by default (requirement changed, should be running by default)
(6/21/06) - switch back to FastPathRenderer for curves (doesn't seem to be any faster, stick with StandardXYItemRenderer)
(6/21/06) - rename BSEigenstatesNode to BSEigenstatesManipulatorNode (would lose CVS history)
(6/21/06) - scale position axis to fit excited portion of wavefunction (not necessary)
(6/9/06) - restore WAVE_FUNCTION_RANGE and PROBABILITY_DENSITY_RANGE (Sam likes the new ranges)
(6/7/06) - method of scaling time-dependent wave function doesn't always result in max amplitude=1 over time (we can't solve this)
(6/7/06) - update while sliders are dragging (fine as is, no one has complained)
(6/7/06) - how does the user know the mass in the Two and Many panels? there is no mass control (not intended to be quantitative)
(6/7/06) - different method of solving when multi-wells are spaced far apart? (we don't have this problem)
(6/6/06) - "superposition state presets" feature (difficult to specify, difficult to implement, not essential to learning goals)
(6/6/06) - help items (can't think of any they want)
(6/2/06) - comment out block of normalization code in SchmidtLeeSolver (values got huge, way off the bottom plot scale)
(6/2/06) - scale the magnifying glass when the canvas size changes (not necessary, difficult, see note in BSAbstractModule.layoutCanvas)
(6/2/06) - set initial mag glass osition, centered on lowest "band" of eigenstates shown in Energy chart (hard code it to most likely position)
(5/17/06) - can't hilite or select lower 1D Coulomb eigenstates when zoomed out (cannot reproduce)
(5/17/06) - bug: Coulomb potential curve disappears when coming back to "One Well" module from another module (cannot reproduce)
(5/17/06) - for square & asymmetric wells with height=0, there are no eigenstates; should lower bound of height be non-zero? (no, this is desirable)
(5/16/06) - use 1D Coulomb wave function to display prob density for 3D Coulomb (vetoed by Carl, too much work)
(5/9/06) - stop looking for Coulomb eigenstates when energy > max visible potential (stop after first 10 eigenstates)
(5/9/06) - represent closely-spaced eigenstates as a thicker line (decided on magnifying glass solution)
(5/9/06) - display values of all closely-spaced eigenstates at the same time (decided on magnifying glass solution)
(5/9/06) - investigate overview interface for energy chart (use more/less zoom instead)
(5/9/06) - magnify width of lines thru magnifying glass (makes eigenstates overlap)
(5/9/06) - show chart ticks & gridlines thru magnifying glass (too damn hard, not necessary)
(5/1/06) - disable the superposition button if no eigenstates are found (we should always find states, and superposition dialog works OK if we don't)
(4/26/06) - change superposition equation for Coulomb to include only even eigenstates? (no)
(4/26/06) - make SchmidtLee.getWaveFunction return Point2D[] instead of double[] (wrapped by BSAbstractPotential.getWaveFunctionPoints)
(4/26/06) - square & asymm wells don't have square sides when dx gets larger, override getPotentialPoints for square & asymm (set pixels-per-sample appropriately)
(4/24/06) - don't construct DecimalFormat, use NumberFormat.getInstance (doesn't do what I need)
(4/21/06) - change semantics of spacing (only works for Square wells, where would we put drag handles?)
(4/17/06) - +5 label on Energy y-axis is clipped (fixed itself when I added a bit to range)
(4/14/06) - eigenstate combo box was dropped from the control panel when we decided to show coefficients for all eigenstates

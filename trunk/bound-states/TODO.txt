"To Do" list for "Bound States" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- replace BSClockControls with standard controls and stopwatch
- Superposition dialog
- Configure Energy dialog
- interaction with eignestate lines
- well curves and drag handles
- commandline options for choosing which modules to display
- update persistence code to include new modules

MEDIUM PRIORITY:


LOW PRIORITY:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive graphics

CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

"To Do" list for "Bound States" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- implement getPoints for each potential type
- need model for superposition coefficients
- ranges are likely wrong in configure dialogs
- change to defaults and ranges in draft #4
- redo BSSquareWell.getPoints, needs to return a lattice that can be used to solve wave function
- problem with width & spacing sliders interaction as their ranges change while dragging in Configure Energy
- relationship in UI between well depth & spacing, how do they affect each others controls?
- each well type is diffent in how drag handles are placed on it
- eigenstates (including selected ones) may be off the top or bottom of the graph, need to handle this!
- very small possibility that double well might have independent depth controls
- support for programmatic multiple selection of eigenstate lines
- normalization of Superposition coefficients has round-off and double precision error
- update persistence code to include new modules
- override reset, save, load methods for each module
- well curves and drag handles
- commandline options for choosing which modules to display
- model
- time-independent solution to Schrodinger equation
- different ranges and default for Single and Double modules
- disable HO and Asymmetric potential choices in Multiple module
- Single and Double modules need to permanently hide the "number of wells" control

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- subscripts should start at 1, except Harmonic Oscillator well starts at 0

LOW PRIORITY:


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- flatten static elements
- setPickable(false) on non-interactive graphics

CLEANUP:
- javadoc all code
- organize imports
- remove unused images and assets
- remove unused localization strings
- resize any scaled images
- save all images using Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature
- fix all javadoc warnings and errors

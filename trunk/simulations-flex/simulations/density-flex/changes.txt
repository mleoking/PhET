Moved the scale further to the left so that it doesn't overlap stacked blocks as much
Removed underwater scale because it seems like a more advanced feature, or more suited for the buoyancy sim
Added superscripts for m^3 in object editing panel
Added character labels to mystery blocks
Fixed: mass readouts on blocks do not update when the mass changes
Added initial support for mystery objects
Fixed default density and volume values for "Objects of same ..." modes
Fixed: the object volume text readout scales with the block size
Switched from styrofoam to wood, since styrofoam barely submerges under water
Improvements for combo box
Fixes for reset all
Made slider thumb more transparent based on how far the value is out of range.
Fixed: When density changes, mass should change.
Changed property editor layout to be: Title, then Slider, then Text readout, then Units
Improvements for custom object and related controls

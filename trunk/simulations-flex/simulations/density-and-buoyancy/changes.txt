Fixed: Visual artifacts when the block is dropped onto the ground next to the pool; its face nearest the pool flickers.
Fixed: The pool readout should be L, not kg/L
# 0.01.16 (43273) Aug 18, 2010
Fixed: Density and Buoyancy links have the same name on a published dev page
Fixed: Object texture doesn’t change when switching from Custom to Lead, while at the Lead density value.
Improvements for slider controls
Fixed: Clicking in the play area causes focus to cycle through components
Improved background and earth graphic now that toybox is implemented differently
Refactored MyMesh and GroundNode to use planes instead of triangles
Refactored MyMesh and GroundNode to use symbolic vertex names
Fixes for box2d and units
Fixed: Mass changes slightly (~1%) when modifying the volume for a custom object
Internationalized strings
Added initial support for continuous color changing of the block color as density changes
Added labeled tick marks to the side of the pool
Fixed: Pool volume readout shows up in the wrong location briefly on startup.
Fixed: Objects shouldn’t poke through front of pool
Fixed: Density slider should snap to tick marks and change the substance type when near to a tick mark.
Fixed: Selecting “Custom” from the combo box should change the object’s substance
Renamed project from "density-flex" to "density-and-buoyancy"
Flipped volume readout so it doesn't block the water
# 0.01.15 (43086) Aug 13, 2010
Switched density output path to be somewhere other than deploy/ since having a folder under deploy/ currently breaks the deploy process halfway through deployment
Fixed: Volume readout on lead is about 2x too large
Improved start location for the custom block
Minor improvements to water volume indicator
Minor improvements to density table
Fixed units for scale readout
Fixed units for scale node
Fixed: In "Objects of same XXX" modes, stacked objects should be staggered and not overlapping each other
Fixed units for objects of same X
Fixed units for density slider ticks
Switched the PropertyEditor sliders to the appropriate units
Increased the length of the sliders to make it easier to set a density less than 1.00 kg/L
Made max volume and density 12 instead of 20 to increase the range of densities less than 1.00 kg/L
Added bitmap texture for lead
Factored out box2d debug graphic
Renamed DensityView => DensityModule and started on model for units
Prevent the box2d debug graphic from intercepting mouse events
Initial support for new scale for the density sim
Refactored modes in DensityViewIntro
Added a table to show densities of various substances in mystery object mode
Fixed: In custom object mode, the density should change when the mass (or volume) is changed.
Added support for typing into text fields
Remove the scale for "objects of same X modes"
# 0.01.14 (43021) Aug 12, 2010
Moved the scale further to the left so that it doesn't overlap stacked blocks as much
Removed underwater scale because it seems like a more advanced feature, or more suited for the buoyancy sim
Added superscripts for m^3 in object editing panel
Added character labels to mystery blocks
Fixed: mass readouts on blocks do not update when the mass changes
Added initial support for mystery objects
Fixed default density and volume values for "Objects of same ..." modes
Fixed: the object volume text readout scales with the block size
Switched from styrofoam to wood, since styrofoam barely submerges under water
Improvements for combo box
Fixes for reset all
Made slider thumb more transparent based on how far the value is out of range.
Fixed: When density changes, mass should change.
Changed property editor layout to be: Title, then Slider, then Text readout, then Units
Improvements for custom object and related controls
# 0.01.13 (42907) Aug 10, 2010
Converted readout to cm3
Added a decimal point to the water height indicator
Removed tabs
# 0.01.12 (42897) Aug 10, 2010
Moved objects to the side of the pool on startup instead of bobbing up and down
Moved the object type combo box to the top of the properties box
Removed advanced tab
Start sim in "Custom Object" mode
Fixed: Exception when hiding custom object properties dialog
Removed scale for custom object
Reworded "properties" to "modes" in the floating dialog
Added radio buttons for "custom object" and "mystery objects"
# 0.01.11 (42679) Jul 27, 2010
# 0.01.10 (42673) Jul 26, 2010
Added a water height indicator
# 0.01.09 (42614) Jul 22, 2010
# 0.01.08 (42613) Jul 22, 2010
Improve rendering for when vector arrow nodes overlap (by giving them slightly different z values)
Improve number formatting for block mass readouts
Improve defaults for objects of same density
Added radio button for objects of same density
# 0.01.07 (42511) Jul 20, 2010
7/20/10 1st tab demo with fixed visual artifacts
# 0.01.02 (42471) Jul 20, 2010
7/20/10 Multiple tabs and vectors
# 0.01.01 (36253) Oct 30, 2009
10/30/09 Density flex first test deployment
Set the front material to smooth to make the fonts smooth instead of jagged
Factored out Block model object, separated from BlockNode view object

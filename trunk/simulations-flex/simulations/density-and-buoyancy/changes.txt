Fixed units for scale readouts
Fixed: Scale readout doesn't always update
Alphabetized mystery substance table 
Fixed: One of the smaller blocks reads "0.5 k" and the "g" is cut off.

Fixed: The pool readout should be L, not kg/L
# 0.01.16 (43273) Aug 18, 2010
Fixed: Density and Buoyancy links have the same name on a published dev page
Fixed: Object texture doesn't change when switching from Custom to Lead, while at the Lead density value.
Improvements for slider controls

Internationalized strings
Added initial support for continuous color changing of the block color as density changes
Added labeled tick marks to the side of the pool
Fixed: Pool volume readout shows up in the wrong location briefly on startup.
Fixed: Objects shouldn't poke through front of pool
Fixed: Density slider should snap to tick marks and change the substance type when near to a tick mark.
Fixed: Selecting "Custom" from the combo box should change the object's substance
Renamed project from "density-flex" to "density-and-buoyancy"
Flipped volume readout so it doesn't block the water
# 0.01.15 (43086) Aug 13, 2010
Switched density output path to be somewhere other than deploy/ since having a folder under deploy/ currently breaks the deploy process halfway through deployment
Fixed: Volume readout on lead is about 2x too large
Improved start location for the custom block
Minor improvements to water volume indicator
Minor improvements to density table
Fixed units for scale readout
Fixed units for scale node
Fixed: In "Objects of same XXX" modes, stacked objects should be staggered and not overlapping each other
Fixed units for objects of same X
Fixed units for density slider ticks
Switched the PropertyEditor sliders to the appropriate units
Increased the length of the sliders to make it easier to set a density less than 1.00 kg/L
Made max volume and density 12 instead of 20 to increase the range of densities less than 1.00 kg/L
Added bitmap texture for lead
Factored out box2d debug graphic
Renamed DensityView => DensityModule and started on model for units
Prevent the box2d debug graphic from intercepting mouse events
Initial support for new scale for the density sim
Refactored modes in DensityViewIntro
Added a table to show densities of various substances in mystery object mode
Fixed: In custom object mode, the density should change when the mass (or volume) is changed.

Remove the scale for "objects of same X modes"
# 0.01.14 (43021) Aug 12, 2010
Moved the scale further to the left so that it doesn't overlap stacked blocks as much

Added superscripts for m^3 in object editing panel
Added character labels to mystery blocks
Fixed: mass readouts on blocks do not update when the mass changes
Added initial support for mystery objects
Fixed default density and volume values for "Objects of same ..." modes
Fixed: the object volume text readout scales with the block size

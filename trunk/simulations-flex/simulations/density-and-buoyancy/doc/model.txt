Description of the model used in "Density" and "Buoyancy"

The underlying collision and intersection behavior is handled through the Flash version of Box2D. We assume standard
gravity and pressure, and that blocks are homogeneous. It runs at 30 frames per second and 10 physics steps per frame.
We take into account air pressure, and the buoyant force is computed as the weight of the displaced fluid (or air).
The drag force is a very rough approximation, related to the total submerged volume of the object, and the density of
the liquid that it is moving through. Friction and elasticity of the surfaces is set in Box2D to seem
realistic-looking. To show the contact forces, we examine all of the impulses given to use for 10 steps by Box2D, scale
them so that we would have the correct forces as # of steps goes to infinity, and then we display the net contact force.
Fluid height is determined by an O(# blocks) computation and should be exact at each physics step.
When an object is user-controlled, it uses Box2D's intersection constraints to push other objects out of the way.
Additionally, torque is not handled and any rotation of the objects is prevented. Otherwise, blocks would be most stable
rotated 45 degrees from the positions we show them in (which is less visually pleasing, and requires more effort for the
water height computations).

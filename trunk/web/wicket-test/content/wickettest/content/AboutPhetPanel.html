        <!--PhET Interactive Simulations is an ongoing effort to provide
        an extensive suite of simulations to improve the way that physics, chemistry,
        biology, earth science and math are taught and learned. The
        <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/index.php">simulations</a> are
        interactive tools that enable students to make connections between real life
        phenomena and the underlying science which explains such phenomena.  Our team
        of scientists, software engineers and science educators use a
        <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/research/index.php">research-based approach</a>
        – incorporating findings from prior research and our own testing – to create
        simulations that support student engagement with and understanding of
        scientific concepts.-->
    </p>

    <p>In order to help students visually comprehend thse concepts,
        PhET simulations animate what is invisible to the eye through the use of
        graphics and intuitive controls such as click-and-drag manipulation, sliders
        and radio buttons.  In order to further encourage quantitative exploration, the
        simulations also offer measurement instruments including rulers, stop-watchs,
        voltmeters and thermometers.  As the user manipulates these interactive tools,
        responses are immediately animated thus effectively illustrating
        cause-and-effects relationships as well as multiple linked representations
        (motion of the objects, graphs, number readouts, etc…).
    </p>

    <p>To ensure eduational effectiveness and usability, all of the
        simulations are extensively tested and evaluated.  These tests include student
        interviews in addition to actual utilization of the simulations in a variety of
        settings, including lectures, group work, homework and lab work.   Our
        <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/about/legend.php">rating system</a> indicates
        what level of testing has been completed on each simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        All PhET simulations are freely available from the <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/index.php">PhET website</a>
        and are easy to use and incorpate into the classroom. They are written in
        <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-java.php">Java</a> and
        <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-flash.php">Flash</a>, and can be run using a standard web
        browser as long as <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-flash.php">Flash</a> and
        <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-java.php">Java</a> are installed.

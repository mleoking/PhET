* Software Requirements

1) Apache Tomcat 6.x  (could in the future be moved to different server software, but this is used right now)
2) PostgreSQL (preferably 8.x, I'm using 8.4)

* Installation

Not covered here. Used http://www.ubuntugeek.com/tomcat-6-installation-on-ubuntu-feisty.html for Tomcat (ignoring the
installing-java part), and used PostgreSQL's default installer. Thus $CATALINA_HOME$ is /usr/share/tomcat6 on
phet-server and my development machines, and PostgreSQL is installed in /opt/PostgreSQL/8.4.

* PostgreSQL configuration

I will use "wickettest" for now as the name of the database.

Create the database:
/opt/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/createdb --encoding=UTF-8 wickettest

You can also create a specific user to access the database with, or use the default "postgres" user.

To initialize the database with a dump file (ending in .sql, most likely wicket-test/postgresql-dump.sql):
/opt/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/psql -U <username> wickettest < /path/to/dump.sql

* How to set up the JNDI datasource within Tomcat's $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/context.xml:

Add the following inside the <context> element in context.xml, and replace the username, password, and any other
settings for correct access to the database (like wickettest with the database name, localhost with the location of the
database).

    <Resource name="jdbc/phet"
              global="jdbc/phet"
              auth="Container"
              type="javax.sql.DataSource"
              username="XXXXX"
              password="YYYYY"
              driverClassName="org.postgresql.Driver"
              url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost/wickettest"
              maxActive="30"
              maxIdle="10"/>

* IDE setup

Tomcat can be used with Eclipse and Intellij for testing. For Intellij, this includes creating a Web facet. The
following directories are important:

wicket-test/root: content root, so everything under this should be placed within the root directory of the WAR file that
    is deployed.
wicket-test/src/java: source root, so these classes

Additionally, the following other sources should be added to the WAR:
phetcommon

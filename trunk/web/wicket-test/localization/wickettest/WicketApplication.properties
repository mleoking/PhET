about.p1=PhET Interactive Simulations is an ongoing effort to provide an extensive suite of simulations to improve the way that physics, chemistry, biology, earth science and math are taught and learned. The <a {0}>simulations</a> are interactive tools that enable students to make connections between real life phenomena and the underlying science which explains such phenomena. Our team of scientists, software engineers and science educators use a <a {1}>research-based approach</a> - incorporating findings from prior research and our own testing - to create simulations that support student engagement with and understanding of scientific concepts.

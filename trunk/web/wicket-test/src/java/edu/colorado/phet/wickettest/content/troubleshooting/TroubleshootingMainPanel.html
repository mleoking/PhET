<div wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q6-answer">
    <p>PhET simulations work best at a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels. (Some of them are written so that they
        cannot be resized.) At lower resolution (e.g. 800 x 600), all the controls may not fit on your screen. At higher
        resolution (e.g. 1280 x 1024), you may not be able to make the simulation fill the whole screen, or if you do,
        it may slow down performance. To change your screen resolution, follow the directions below:</p>

    <p><strong>Windows Vista</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>From Start menu, click on "Control Panel."</li>

        <li>Press "Adjust screen resolution" under "Appearance and Personalization."</li>
        <li>Use the "Screen resolution" slider to select a resolution and click "OK."</li>

        <li>From Start menu, click on "Control Panel."</li>

        <li>Double click on "Display" icon.</li>
        <li>Select the "Settings" tab.</li>
        <li>Use the "Screen resolution" slider to select a resolution and click "OK."</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Macintosh</strong></p>

    <ol>

        <li>Open the System Preferences (either from the Dock or from the Apple menu).</li>
        <li>Open the Displays Panel and choose the Display tab.</li>
        <li>On the left of the Displays tab you can select one of the Resolutions from the list.</li>

<div wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q7-answer">
    <p>Some Windows 2000 systems have been reported to lack part of the necessary Java configuration. These systems will
        typically start our Flash-based simulations reliably, but will appear to do nothing when launching our

    <p><strong>To resolve this situation, please perform the following steps:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>From the desktop or start menu, open "My Computer"</li>

        <li>Click on the "Folder Options" item in the "Tools" menu</li>
        <li>Click on the "File Types" tab at the top of the window that appears</li>
        <li>Locate "JNLP" in the "extensions" column, and click once on it to select the item</li>
        <li>Click on the "change" button</li>
        <li>When asked to choose which program to use to open JNLP files, select "Browse"</li>
        <li>
            Locate the program "javaws" or "javaws.exe" in your Java installation folder (typically "C:\Program
            Files\Java\j2re1.xxxx\javaws", where "xxxx" is a series of numbers indicating the software version; choose

        Why do PhET simulations run slower on my laptop than on a desktop?
    </wicket:message>
</h3>
<div wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q8-answer">
    <p>On some laptop computers, simulations may appear to run much slower than anticipated and/or exhibit unexpected
        graphics problems. This may be due to power management settings that affect how the computer's graphics system
        runs and can be corrected by either a) changing the computer's power management configuration, or b) using the
        laptop computer while plugged in to an AC power source.</p>

    <p>Many laptop computers are configured to reduce the amount of battery power used by the graphics/video system
        while the computer is running on battery power. If you must use the laptop while it is not plugged in, we
        suggest changing your computer's power management settings to "maximize performance" while unplugged. This
        should ensure that the graphics system runs at its peak speed. The location of this setting varies from one
        manufacturer to the next and we suggest contacting your computer vendor if you have difficulty locating it.
        Please contact us at <a href="mailto:phethelp@colorado.edu?Subject=Laptop%20Performance%20Issues">phethelp@colorado.edu</a>

        I have downloaded and installed the PhET Offline Website Installer, and I get a warning on every page. Why?
    </wicket:message>
</h3>
<div wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q11-answer">
    <p>The <a href="../get_phet/full_install.php">PhET Offline Website Installer</a> creates a local copy of the current
        version of the PhET website on your computer. When you access this locally installed copy, your computer will
        use your default browser, which for many people is Internet Explorer. If the security settings are set to their
        default values, you may get an error that says <em>"To help protect your security, Internet Explorer has
            restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls that could access your computer. Click here
            for options..."</em> (or something similar). This is a security feature of Internet Explorer version 6 and
        later, and is meant to warn users about running active content locally. The PhET simulations present no danger
        to your computer, and running them locally is no different than running them from the web site.
    </p>

    <p>If you wish to disable this warning, you can do so by adjusting your browser's security settings. For IE versions
        6 and 7, the way to do this is to go into Tools->Internet Options->Advanced, find the "Security" heading, and
        check "Allow active content to run in files on My Computer". Note that you will need to restart Internet
        Explorer to get this change to take effect. You should only do this if feel confident that there is no other
        off-line content that you may run on your computer that could be malicious.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, you could use a different browser (such as Firefox) that does not have this issue.

        What does this mean?
    </wicket:message>
</h3>
<div wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q12-answer">
    <p>The PhET simulations that are distributed with the installer include a "digital certificate" that verifies that
        these simulations were actually created by PhET. This is a security measure that helps to prevent an
        unscrupulous individual from creating applications that claim to be produced by PhET but are not. If the
        certificate acceptance dialog says that the publisher is "PhET, University of Colorado", and the dialog also
        says that the signature was validated by a trusted source, you can have a high degree of confidence that the
        application was produced by the PhET team.</p>

    <p>On most systems, it is possible to permanently accept the PhET certificate and thereby prevent this dialog from
        appearing each time a simulation is run locally. Most Windows and Max OSX systems have a check box on the
        certificate acceptance dialog that says "Always trust content from this publisher". Checking this box will
        configure your system in such a way that the dialog will no longer appear when starting up PhET simulations.</p>

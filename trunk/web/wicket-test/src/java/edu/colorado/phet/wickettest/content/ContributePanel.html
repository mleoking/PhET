            Our philosophy is to make PhET simulations freely available to all users around the world. They have now
            been
            run millions of times from our web site, and the full PhET suite has been installed on thousands of
            computers. But while the simulations may be free to users, they are expensive for us to create, test and
            maintain, and our financial support is limited. If you would like to help make it possible for us to develop
            more and better simulations, please contact
            <a href="mailto:phethelp@colorado.edu?Subject=Financial%20Contribution&amp;Body=Dear%20Sir%20or%20Madam:%20I%20would%20like%20to%20make%20a%20generous%20donation%20to%20PhET.">phethelp@colorado.edu</a>
            or phone (303-492-4367) to find out how you can make a tax deductible contribution.

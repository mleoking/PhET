tdAutoSelectBox

=====================================================

tdAutoSelectBox is designed to fully replace the browser rendered select boxes
and multi-select boxes.  Apart from avoiding the various issues with the browser 
rendering of select boxes, tdAutoSelectBox adds the ability for a user to type 
inside the select box for faster entry. You may also further customize tdAutoSelectBox 
in ways that are impossible with the browser rendered select boxes and mult-select boxes.

For detailed instructs, please view the Readme.HTML file, and follow the guide.

A lot of bugs people are reporting are because they forget to include the tdStyles.css on their
webpage (or do not put the styles in their site's css).  Please read documentation.

Do not rename the folder where the code resides, or move the js code elsewhere -- this will break functionality.

Winter 2010 Newsletter - PhET Interactive Simulations

PhET's New Directions

While we're continuing to advance our core programs in designing and researching physics simulations and activities, we're also expanding into new disciplines, lower grade levels and new collaborations. We are actively developing sims in chemistry, and piloting programs in math, geology and biology. This fall we'll begin a new effort focused on middle schoolers, including research, simulation development and activity design specifically for younger learners. Finally, we're ramping up our collaboration efforts to reach more students and teachers. PhET is now listed in multiple teacher resource databases and used in several textbooks and online programs.

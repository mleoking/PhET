* Software Requirements

1) Apache Tomcat 6.x  (could in the future be moved to different server software, but this is used right now)
2) PostgreSQL (preferably 8.x, I'm using 8.4)

* Installation

Not covered here. Used http://www.ubuntugeek.com/tomcat-6-installation-on-ubuntu-feisty.html for Tomcat (ignoring the
installing-java part), and used PostgreSQL's default installer. Thus $CATALINA_HOME$ is /usr/share/tomcat6 on
phet-server and my development machines, and PostgreSQL is installed in /opt/PostgreSQL/8.4.

* PostgreSQL configuration

I will use "website" for now as the name of the database.

Create the database:
/opt/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/createdb --encoding=UTF-8 website

You can also create a specific user to access the database with, or use the default "postgres" user.

To initialize the database with a dump file (ending in .sql, most likely wicket-website/postgresql-dump.sql):
/opt/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/psql -U <username> website < /path/to/dump.sql

* How to set up the JNDI datasource within Tomcat's $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/context.xml:

Add the following inside the <context> element in context.xml, and replace the username, password, and any other
settings for correct access to the database (like website with the database name, localhost with the location of the
database).

    <Resource name="jdbc/phet"
              global="jdbc/phet"
              auth="Container"
              type="javax.sql.DataSource"
              username="XXXXX"
              password="YYYYY"
              driverClassName="org.postgresql.Driver"
              url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost/website"
              maxActive="30"
              maxIdle="10"/>

* Tomcat configuration

In $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/server.xml, make sure the Connector elements being used have useBodyEncodingForURI="true",
otherwise UTF-8 characters sent through translation that aren't in the Basic Multilingual Plane will be clobbered.

For a development machine, add this line to $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/context.xml within the Context element:
<Parameter name="configuration" value="development" override="false"/>

For a production machine, use this line instead:
<Parameter name="configuration" value="deployment" override="false"/>

The configuration parameter above will trigger either the "development" or "deployment" mode for Wicket.

Additionally, the temp dir (usually $CATALINA_HOME$/temp) should definitely be writable by the Tomcat daemon, since
this is the location of EHCache's temporary files.

* IDE setup

Tomcat can be used with Eclipse and Intellij for testing. For Intellij, this includes creating a Web facet. The
following directories are important:

wicket-website/root: content root, so everything under this should be placed within the root directory of the WAR file that
    is deployed.
wicket-website/src/java: source root, so these classes

Additionally, the following other sources should be added to the WAR:
phetcommon
(phetcommon's data directory)

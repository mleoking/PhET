            <strong>PLEASE READ THIS PAGE COMPLETELY BEFORE USING TRANSLATION UTILITY.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>The Translation Utility can be used to create a translation for a new language, or to edit an existing
            translation. In both cases, the instructions are the same.</p>

        <h2>
            General instructions
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Download <a href="get-translation-utility.php">translation-utility.jar</a> to your computer.
            </li>

            <li>
                Go to the PhET website and download the JAR file for the simulation that you want to translate (press
                the "Download" button on a simulation page).
            </li>

            <li>
                Double-click on translation-utility.jar to start the Translation Utility.
            </li>

            <li>
                Enter the full path name of the simulation's JAR file.
            </li>

            <li>
                Select the language that you're translating from the option menu. If your language is not listed in the
                menu, contact <a href="mailto:phethelp@colorado.edu?subject=Translation%20Utility"><span class="red">phethelp@colorado.edu</span></a>
                to request a custom language code. When you receive your custom language code, select CUSTOM from the
                option menu (the last option in the menu) and enter your custom language code in the text box that
                appears.
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the "Continue" button.
            </li>

            <li>
                Enter the translated strings in the right-most column of text fields.
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the "Test" button to run the simulation with the translated strings.
            </li>

            <li>
                Use the "Save" and "Load" buttons to save and load your work.
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the "Submit to PhET" button when you've finished your translations. This saves your translation to
                a file, which you can email to PhET. Note the file name and email address shown in the dialog.
            </li>

            <li>
                Email the translation file to PhET.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h2>
            Example Usage
        </h2>

        <p>
            This example shows how to translate "Models of the Hydrogen Atom" to French.
        </p>

        <ol>

            <li>
                Download translation-utility.jar to your computer.
            </li>

            <li>
                Go <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/sims.php?sim=Models_of_the_Hydrogen_Atom">here</a> and
                click the "Download" button. This will download hydrogen-atom_en.jar.
            </li>

            <li>

                Double-click on translation-utility.jar to start the Translation Utility.
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the "Browse" button and locate hydrogen-atom.jar that you downloaded.
            </li>

            <li>
                Select "French (fr) from the language option menu.
            </li>

            <li>

                Press the "Continue" button.
            </li>

            <li>
                Enter the French translations in the right-most column of text fields. For example, for
                hydrogen-atom.name, enter "My French Title".
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the "Test" button to run the simulation with the translated strings. You'll see the simulation
                start with "My French Title" in the progress dialog.
            </li>

            <li>

                Save your work to a file using the "Save" button. You can exit the Translation Utility and load that
                file later using the "Load" button.
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the "Submit to PhET" button. Your translations will be saved in
                hydrogen-atom-strings_fr.properties.
            </li>

            <li>
                Email hydrogen-atom-strings_fr.properties to phethelp@colorado.edu.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Strings</h2>

        <p>
            Some strings that appear in a simulation are part of a library of "common components" that are used in all
            PhET simulations.
            We refer to these strings as "common strings".
            Examples of common strings include: the "File" menu, the "Help" menu, the Play/Pause/Step buttons that
            control the clock.
            When you're translating a simulation, Translation Utility does not allow you to translate common strings.
        </p>

        <p>
            To translate common strings, you'll need to download special JAR files to your computer.
            There are separate JAR files (and separate sets of common strings) for Java and Flash simulations.
            To translate Java common strings, download <a
                href="get-java-common-strings.php">java-common-strings_en.jar</a>.
            To translate Flash common strings, download <a href="get-flash-common-strings.php">flash-common-strings_en.jar</a>.
            Load these JAR files into Translation Utility in the same way that you would for a simulation JAR file.
            You only need to translate each JAR once, and we will incorporate your translations into all simulations.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Caveats
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Some of the strings that appear in the Translation Utility may not appear in the simulation that you are
                translating. This is because similar simulations (eg, the variants of Circuit Construction Kit) share
                one translation file. If a string does not appear in the simulation that you're translating, feel free
                to leave it blank.
            </li>
        </ul>

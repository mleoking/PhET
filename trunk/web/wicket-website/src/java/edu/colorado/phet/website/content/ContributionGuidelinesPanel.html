            The PhET simulations are specifically designed and tested to
            support student learning. However, what students do with the sims is as important as the
            simulations themselves. PhET sims may be used in many different types of activities but
            we believe the sims are most effective when integrated with guided inquiry activities
            which encourage students to construct their own understanding. We suggest:

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Creating PhET Activities using Guided Inquiry Strategies</h2>

        <p>
            The PhET simulations are specifically designed and tested to
            support student learning. However, what students do with the sims is as important as the
            simulations themselves. PhET sims may be used in many different types of activities but
            we believe the sims are most effective when integrated with guided inquiry activities
            which encourage students to construct their own understanding. We suggest:

                <span class="contrib-guide-header">Define specific learning goals</span><br/>
                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    The learning goals need to be specific and measurable. Many of the sims are complex and
                    students can become overwhelmed; align the lesson with your goals.

                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    The activity should be geared towards encouraging the student to operate in learning
                    mode not performance mode. What can they discover about the physics? What
                    connections do they find? How does it make sense? How do they explain what they
                    discover?

                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    Ask questions to elicit their ideas. Guide students' use of the sims to test their ideas and
                    confirm their ideas or confront any misconceptions. Provide ways for them to resolve
                    their understanding.

                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    Students will learn more if they can see that the knowledge is relevant to their everyday
                    life. The sims use images from everyday life, but the lesson should explicitly help them
                    relate to their lives. As you write the questions and examples, consider their interests,
                    age, gender, and ethnicity.

                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    The sims provide a common language for students to construct their understanding
                    together. More learning happens when they communicate their ideas and reasoning to
                    each other.

                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    The sims are designed and tested to encourage students to explore and make-sense.
                    Recipe-type directions can suppress their active thinking.

                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    The sims are designed to help students develop and test their understanding and
                    reasoning about things. Lessons are most effective when students are asked to explain
                    their reasoning in a variety of ways.

                <span class="contrib-guide-content">
                    Provide opportunities for students to check their own understanding. One way is to ask
                    them to predict something based on their new knowledge and then check the prediction
                    with the simulation.

                The PhET simulations are specifically designed and tested to
                support student learning. However, what students do with the sims is as important as the
                simulations themselves. PhET sims may be used in many different types of activities but
                we believe the sims are most effective when integrated with guided inquiry activities
                which encourage students to construct their own understanding. We suggest:

                <td>

                <td>translation/</td>
                <td>Everything having to do with website translation</td>

        </table>

        <h3>Overall Server Organization</h3>

        <p>
            Apache HTTPD is used as the front end. HTTPD serves the static content directly (sims directories,
            publications, etc.) All other requests are forwarded to Tomcat, which runs Java code written for the Wicket
            framework. They are forwarded using the Tomcat Connector (mod_jk), and should be running on the same machine
            so that the Wicket code can have read/write access to the HTTPD content.
        </p>

        <h2>Setup of a Production / Development Server</h2>

        <h3>Software requirements</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Currently some variant of linux, but advanced users could probably get it running on windows or mac</li>
            <li>
                Apache Tomcat 6.x (could in the future be moved to different server software, but this is used right now
            </li>
            <li>Postgresql 8.x (tested with 8.4+)</li>
            <li>Apache HTTPD 2.2.x (untested on the 2.0.x series)</li>
            <li>Apache Tomcat Connector (mod_jk, http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/ and tested with 1.2.28)</li>
            <li>Apache GZip compression (mod_deflate)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Installation of Tomcat, Postgresql, Apache and the connector not covered here. Used
            http://www.ubuntugeek.com/tomcat-6-installation-on-ubuntu-feisty.html for Tomcat (ignoring the
            installing-java part), and used PostgreSQL's default installer. Thus $CATALINA_HOME$ is /usr/share/tomcat6
            on
            phet-server and my development machines, and PostgreSQL is installed in /opt/PostgreSQL/8.4. Apache HTTPD
            can also use
            a standard installation, many documents are available online (or for linux, just install the packages).
            mod_jk can be downloaded from the above mentioned website, installed as mod_jk.so what is usually
            /usr/lib/apache2/modules/ and loaded as a module in httpd.conf.
        </p>


        <h3>Postgresql Configuration</h3>

        <p>I will use "website" for now as the name of the database.</p>

        <p>
            Create the database:
        </p>
        <pre>/opt/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/createdb --encoding=UTF-8 website</pre>

        <p>
            You can also create a specific user to access the database with, or use the default "postgres" user.
        </p>

        <p>
            To initialize the database with a dump file:
        </p>
        <pre>/opt/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/psql -U [username] website &lt; /path/to/dump.sql</pre>

        <p>
            Dump files can be found on figaro at /data/web/htdocs/phetsims/website-backup/website-database/backups, or
            can be produced with the following command:
        </p>

        <pre>pg_dump --clean website_production -h figaro.colorado.edu &gt; postgresql-dump.sql</pre>


        <h3>Apache Configuration</h3>

        <p>
            Apache needs to be configured to send certain requests to Tomcat, but for other requests to handle them
            itself. First create a workers.properties file and place with Apache configuration
            (example of /etc/apache2/workers.properties) with the following contents:
        </p>

        <pre>
worker.list=worker1
worker.worker1.type=ajp13
worker.worker1.host=localhost
worker.worker1.port=8009
        </pre>

        <p>
            Port 8009 will be used to communicate between Apache and Tomcat. When a request comes into Apache that it
            needs to process, a request will be sent through this port.
        </p>

        <p>
            In an Apache configuration file (in this case httpd.conf, but could be elsewhere) add the following or
            equivalents:
        </p>

        <pre>
LoadModule jk_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_jk.so

JkWorkersFile /etc/apache2/workers.properties
JkShmFile /var/log/apache2/mod_jk.shm
JkLogFile /var/log/apache2/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel info
JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "
        </pre>

        <p>
            In the same place or in a separate VirtualHost declaration, we need to specify a DocumentRoot, mod_jk mounts
            and compression settings.
        </p>

        <pre>
DocumentRoot /var/phet
JkMount /* worker1
JkUnMount /sims/* worker1
JkUnMount /publications/* worker1
JkUnMount /workshops/* worker1
JkUnMount /files/* worker1
JkUnMount /installer/* worker1
JkUnMount /newsletters/* worker1
JkUnMount /statistics/* worker1
JkUnMount /staging/* worker1            

&lt;Location/&gt;
# mod_deflate (compress output for browsers that support it)
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css application/x-javascript text/javascript text/x-js application/json application/xml application/javascript
    BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html
    BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip
    BrowserMatch \bMSIE\s7 !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html
    BrowserMatch \bMSIE\s8 !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html
&lt;/Location&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>
            Whether using straight hosting or virtual hosts, a particular document root should be chosen that will hold
            all of the "static" files, like the sims, publications and workshops directories. The DocumentRoot is
            important and needs to be configured in a few places. /var/phet will be used in this example.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apache HTTPD will need to be restarted after these changes. Usually "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart" works
        </p>

        <h3>Copy document root files</h3>

        <p>
            Now we need to copy over certain data files that are stored within the DocumentRoot on figaro. Figaro's
            document root is /data/web/htdocs/phetsims. All files under that (except for possibly website-backup) should
            be copied to our new document root. Be aware that even without the website-backup directory it currently
            runs about 5 GB. Best way is to tar it with:
        </p>

        <pre>tar -czf ~/docroot.tar.gz /data/web/htdocs/phetsims</pre>

        <p>And then use SCP to transfer the compressed archive</p>


        <h3>Tomcat Configuration</h3>

        <p>
            Tomcat configuration is usually stored under $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/, or /etc/tomcat6.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, copy in a build-local.properties with the jarsigner info, and the code certificate and place in the
            configuration directory. Make sure non-phet members do not have access to these files (chmod o-rw).
        </p>

        <h4>server.xml</h4>

        <p>
            Under $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/ there should be a server.xml. Inside, there should be a few Connector elements.
            Append the following attribute to all connectors:
        </p>

        <pre>useBodyEncodingForURI="true"</pre>

        <p>
            This will ensure that the website translation AJAX queries work with UTF-8 characters. Additionally, verify
            that we have one Connector element for our port specified above (8009):
        </p>

        <pre>&lt;Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" useBodyEncodingForURI="true" /&gt;</pre>

        <h4>context.xml</h4>

        <p>
            This context file (also under $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/ is used to pass in data and connections specific to this
            running instance of the website
        </p>

        <p>
            First we need to set up the JNDI datasource for context.xml. Add the following inside the &lt;Context&gt;
            element in context.xml, and replace the username, password, and any other settings for correct access to the
            database (like in this example "website" with the database name, "localhost" with the location of the
            database).
        </p>

        <pre>
&lt;Resource name="jdbc/phet"
          global="jdbc/phet"
          auth="Container"
          type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          username="XXXXX"
          password="YYYYY"
          driverClassName="org.postgresql.Driver"
          url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost/website"
          maxActive="30"
          maxIdle="10"/&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>For a development machine, add this line to the Context element:</p>
        <pre>&lt;Parameter name="configuration" value="development" override="false"/&gt;</pre>

        <p>For a production machine, use this line instead:</p>
        <pre>&lt;Parameter name="configuration" value="deployment" override="false"/&gt;</pre>

        <p>The configuration parameter above will trigger either the "development" or "deployment" mode for Wicket.</p>

        <p>We need to add the location of the build-local.properties in:</p>
        <pre>&lt;Parameter name="build-local-properties" value="/usr/share/tomcat6/conf/build-local.properties" override="true"/&gt;</pre>

        <p>Furthermore, we need to configure a few more paths. The document root should be provided directly</p>
        <pre>&lt;Parameter name="phet-document-root" value="/var/phet" override="true" /&gt;</pre>

        <p>
            The download root is where other miscellaneous files could be. This is separated out so it could be located
            under another virtual host for added security
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;Parameter name="phet-download-root" value="/var/phet/files" override="true" /&gt;</pre>

        <p>We also need to specify an absolute URL for the location of the download root for outside sources</p>
        <pre>&lt;Parameter name="phet-download-location" value="http://localhost/files" override="true" /&gt;</pre>

        <p>
            Additionally, the temp dir (usually $CATALINA_HOME$/temp) should definitely be writable by the Tomcat
            daemon, since
            this is the location of EHCache's temporary files and the search index.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also the appropriate JDBC driver should be copied into $CATALINA_HOME$/lib/
            (ie trunk/web/wicket-website/contrib/postgresql-8.3-604.jdbc4.jar).
        </p>

        <p>
            Further parameters starting with "transfer-" to context.xml and the MySQL connector to lib/ can be added for
            use transferring data from a copy of the MySQL database used with the PHP site.
        </p>


        <h3>IDE Setup</h3>

        <p>
            Not terribly critical, because PBG can build and deploy the website. It is also recommended for deploying
            test versions
        </p>

        <p>Add sources of trunk/web/wicket-website/src/java and if desired trunk/web/wicket-website/src/test</p>

        <p>
            Add the following JARs to your classpath (along with any others for phetcommon and build-tools):
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Everything under trunk/web/wicket-website/root/WEB-INF/lib/</li>
            <li>Java EE (stored at trunk/web/wicket-website/contrib/javaee.jar)</li>
            <li>For tests, JUnit (trunk/simulations-java/contrib/junit)</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>PBG Deployment Setup</h3>

        <p>
            To support deployment from PBG to the server, it is necessary to install the Tomcat Manager application.
            It may already be installed in default configurations.
        </p>

        <p>Then, edit $CATALINA_HOME$/conf/tomcat-users.xml to add the following line:</p>

        <pre>&lt;user username="USER" password="PASSWORD" roles="admin,manager"/&gt;</pre>

        <p>
            Where USER and PASSWORD are replaced with a secure username and password for each user that should have
            the ability to deploy.
        </p>

                    Either 'http' or 'https' depending on whether encryption is used for Tomcat Manager. Try going to
                    /manager/html on the target machine and looking at the protocol used.

        <p>
            The above settings are for a production server, and "Deploy Prod" in PBG. For the development server
            ("Deploy Dev"), replace 'prod' with 'dev'. Settings for both one production and one development server can
            be included currently in build-local.properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then to deploy, open PBG, navigate to the "wicket-website" project (currently conveniently located at the
            bottom) and click either "Deploy Dev" or "Deploy Prod".

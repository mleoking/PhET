        <p wicket:id="contribute-main">
            Our philosophy is to make PhET simulations freely available to all users around the world. They have now
            been run millions of times from our web site, and the full PhET suite has been installed on thousands of
            computers. But while the simulations may be free to users, they are expensive for us to create, test and
            maintain, and our financial support is limited. If you would like to help make it possible for us to develop
            more and better simulations, you can make a quick
            <a href="http://www.cufund.org/giving-opportunities/fund-description/?id=3685">tax-deductible donation</a>.
            For any additional questions on the donation process, you can call us at (303) 492-4367.
        </p>

        <h2>How Your Donations Help</h2>

        <p>
            * Here we talk in more detail about how donations (even small ones) can make a difference. Possibly look at
            the cost of a simulations divided by the number of simulation runs, then quote in terms of "it costs $x to
            create / test / maintain a simulation for Y runs / classrooms / etc."
        </p>

        <h2>Sponsors</h2>

        <p wicket:id="contribute-thanks">
            PhET would like to thank <a href="../sponsors/index.php">our sponsors</a>, and
            <a href="http://www.royalinteractive.com/">Royal Interactive</a> for original site design and layout.

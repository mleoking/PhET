"To Do" list for "Translation Utility"
================================================================================

OPEN ISSUES:
- how to deliver the Translation Utility
- how to update the Translation Utility if it's bundled inside every sim
- how to Submit to PhET
- how to access Flash localization files
- how to run Flash player from Java
- how to get default translations from Google Translate
- Java app versus web app


HIGH PRIORITY:
- replace exec("jar...") with java.util.jar API

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- save/load work in progress
- Flash sim support

LOW PRIORITY:
- File>Exit or Quit button
- check for unsaved changes before exiting
- clean up files and directories created


DONE:
10/30/07 - if a translation exists for the target country code, use it
10/30/07 - add dialog to request JAR file and target country code
10/29/07 - quick-&-dirty (non-portable) solution to allow testing of translation using Runtime.exec

"To Do" list for "Translation Utility"
================================================================================

OPEN ISSUES:
- how to access Flash localization files
- how to run Flash player from Java

HIGH PRIORITY:
- revise JarFileManager interface
- refactor Translation.findNext and findPrevious
- refactor TranslationPanel
- refactor code base

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- check for unsaved changes before exiting
- Find dialog uses default font, what to do for languages that have preferred fonts?
- Flash sim support
- delete phet-test-translation.jar

LOW PRIORITY:
- replace Find dialog with a panel above the button panel, ala Firefox
- Find selection disappears when Find dialog is closed
- Edit>Undo for editing target textfields
- add buttons to access translations for common projects, inform user about the gravity of editing common translations
- make runnable via Web Start
- perform default translation using Google Translate
- replace individual Google Translate requests with 1 big request to workaround "denial of service" problem
- rewrite com.google.api.translate.Translate so that it handles problems (accessing URL, service denial, unsupported language, etc)
- Google Translate server returns HTTP response code 400 (bad request) when called with an unsupported language
- File>New to start a new translation, instead of restarting
- select the simulation from a list and download the associated JAR from within Translation Utility

REJECTED:
11/29/07 - make Find insensitive to case (problematic to generalized this for all language codes)

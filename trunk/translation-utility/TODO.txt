"To Do" list for "Translation Utility"
================================================================================

OPEN ISSUES:
- how to bundle a Flash sim into a single JAR to fit our model?
- how to run the Flash player from Java, with a specified locale?

HIGH PRIORITY:

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- refactor to support alternate strategies for Flash sims
- replace Properties with a neutral data abstraction, or map Flash XML to Properties
- support translation of common Java projects
- check for unsaved changes before exiting
- support translation of Flash sims
- delete phet-test-translation.jar
- other strategies for submitting translations to PhET
- build.xml

LOW PRIORITY:
- Find dialog uses source language font for its text field, can't enter characters that are specific to target language font
- replace Find dialog with a panel above the button panel, ala Firefox
- Edit>Undo for editing target textfields
- make runnable via Web Start (will Runtime.exec work?)
- perform default translation using Google Translate
- replace individual Google Translate requests with 1 big request to workaround "denial of service" problem
- localize error messages in GoogleTranslateService
- add File>New to start a new translation, instead of restarting
- select a desired simulation from a list and automatically download the associated JAR from the PhET website
- bug: pressing Help button causes scrollpane to scroll to top
- bug: Load allows user to load a properties file that doesn't pertain to the simulation
- bug: scrollpane scrolls when loading a properties file
- bug: text that is manually-selected while Find dialog is open will stay selected when selection changes via Find

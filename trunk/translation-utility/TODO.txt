"To Do" list for "Translation Utility"
================================================================================

OPEN ISSUES:
- how to Submit to PhET
- how to access Flash localization files
- how to run Flash player from Java

HIGH PRIORITY:
- replace individual property translation requests with 1 big request to workaround Google Translate denial of service
- rewrite Goggle's Translate class so that it handles problems (acessing URL, service denial, unsupported language, etc)
- Google Translate server returns HTTP response code 400 (bad request) when called with an unsupported language

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- add buttons to access translations for common projects, inform user about the gravity of editing common translations
- exception when writing properties file to filesystem shouldn't be fatal, might be permissions problem
- choose specific fonts for specific languages (generalize FontJA)
- save/load work in progress
- Flash sim support

LOW PRIORITY:
- check for unsaved changes before exiting
- File>New to start a new translation
- select simulation from Translation Utility


DONE:
11/13/07 - add disabled Save and Load buttons (for discussion)
11/13/07 - add PhET logo to init dialog, delete lame instructions that no one will read
11/13/07 - localize all strings in InitializationDialog
11/13/07 - reduce vertical height of frame on Windows to account for Windows task bar
11/13/07 - center frame on screen
11/13/07 - revert to better implementation of JarFileManager.writeProperties
11/13/07 - don't modify original JAR file, test using phet-test-translation.jar
11/13/07 - check in eclipse .classpath file
11/13/07 - disable "use Google Translate" checkbox
11/13/07 - rewrite JarFileManager.writeProperties similar to developer.com example, otherwise tmpFile rename fails
11/13/07 - test apps for inserting file into a JAR
11/13/07 - TUMenuBar
11/12/07 - test what happens when calling Google Translate with an unsupported language (HTTP response code 400, bad request) 
11/12/07 - clean up tmp JAR file if something goes wrong
11/12/07 - remember current directory while browsing for JAR file
11/12/07 - extract common method for forming localization file names
11/12/07 - bugfix: JarFileManager.discoverProjectName exception due to '\' being both the regex escape char and Windows file.separator
11/12/07 - test whitespace in file pathnames on Windows
11/9/07 - handle whitespace in file pathnames, use Process.exec(String[]) to prevent Java from tokenizing at whitespace
11/9/07 - add "use Google Translate" checkbox to init dialog
11/9/07 - add menu bar with File>Exit menu item
11/9/07 - implement "Submit" that creates properties file with instructions to email it to phethelp@colorado.edu
11/9/07 - increase frame width so we don't get a horizontal scrollbar
11/9/07 - support for flavors of sims (where jar filename is not same as project name)
11/6/07 - move all string literals to localization file
11/6/07 - make exception handling more robust, post dialogs when unrecoverable errors occur
11/5/07 - project properties file for translation-utility
11/5/07 - remove dependency on "jar" command, replace with java.util.jar API
11/2/07 - disable Google Translate feature, defer
11/2/07 - integrate with Google Translate
11/2/07 - Sam Reid added contrib/google-translate-api and related test programs
********* version 0.00.02 (18434)
11/1/07 - first version that works on Win and Mac
11/1/07 - version that works as double-clickable JAR on Win98 with JDK installed
11/1/07 - use System.getProperty("file.separator") for forming path names
11/1/07 - version that works under Cygwin on Win98 with JDK installed
11/1/07 - convert all pathnames to use UNIX file separators (for testing with Cygwin on Windows)
11/1/07 - enable debug output for exec'ed commands
11/1/07 - don't use full pathnames for jar and java, assume they're in the user's path
10/30/07 - if a translation exists for the target country code, use it
10/30/07 - add dialog to request JAR file and target country code
********* version 0.00.01 (18366)
10/29/07 - quick-&-dirty (non-portable, UNIX/Mac only) solution to allow testing of translation using Runtime.exec

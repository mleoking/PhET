"To Do" list for "Translation Utility"
================================================================================

OPEN ISSUES:
- how to present common localization
- how to deliver the Translation Utility
- how to update the Translation Utility if it's bundled inside every sim
- how to Submit to PhET
- how to access Flash localization files
- how to run Flash player from Java
- how to get default translations from Google Translate
- Java app versus web app


HIGH PRIORITY:
- renaming tmpFile to jarFile fails on Windows in JarFileManager.writeProperties
- replace individual property translation requests with 1 big request to workaround Google Translate denial of service
- rewrite Goggle's Translate class so that it handles problems (acessing URL, service denial, unsupported language, etc)
- what happens when a request is made to Google Translate that involves an unsupported language?

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- browsing for JAR file should remember which directory we're in
- exception when writing properties file to filesystem shouldn't be fatal, might be permissions problem
- choose specific fonts for specific languages (generalize FontJA)
- save/load work in progress
- Flash sim support
- select simulation from Translation Utility

LOW PRIORITY:
- check for unsaved changes before exiting
- clean up files and directories created


DONE:
11/12/07 - bugfix: JarFileManager.discoverProjectName exception due to '\' being both the regex escape char and Windows file.separator
11/12/07 - test whitespace in file pathnames on Windows
11/9/07 - handle whitespace in file pathnames, use Process.exec(String[]) to prevent Java from tokenizing at whitespace
11/9/07 - add "use Google Translate" checkbox to init dialog
11/9/07 - add menu bar with File>Exit menu item
11/9/07 - implement "Submit" that creates properties file with instructions to email it to phethelp@colorado.edu
11/9/07 - increase frame width so we don't get a horizontal scrollbar
11/9/07 - support for flavors of sims (where jar filename is not same as project name)
11/6/07 - move all string literals to localization file
11/6/07 - make exception handling more robust, post dialogs when unrecoverable errors occur
11/5/07 - project properties file for translation-utility
11/5/07 - remove dependency on "jar" command, replace with java.util.jar API
11/2/07 - disable Google Translate feature, defer
11/2/07 - integrate with Google Translate
11/2/07 - Sam Reid added contrib/google-translate-api and related test programs
********* version 0.00.02 (18434)
11/1/07 - first version that works on Win and Mac
11/1/07 - version that works as double-clickable JAR on Win98 with JDK installed
11/1/07 - use System.getProperty("file.separator") for forming path names
11/1/07 - version that works under Cygwin on Win98 with JDK installed
11/1/07 - convert all pathnames to use UNIX file separators (for testing with Cygwin on Windows)
11/1/07 - enable debug output for exec'ed commands
11/1/07 - don't use full pathnames for jar and java, assume they're in the user's path
10/30/07 - if a translation exists for the target country code, use it
10/30/07 - add dialog to request JAR file and target country code
********* version 0.00.01 (18366)
10/29/07 - quick-&-dirty (non-portable, UNIX/Mac only) solution to allow testing of translation using Runtime.exec

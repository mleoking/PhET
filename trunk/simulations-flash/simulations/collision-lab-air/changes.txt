Workaround for iOS where "." is treated properly without adding a leading "0"
Added resized icons in properly
Moved the units label row down towards the data
Removed padding around the "units" row in the data table
Fixed data table "mass" entry: can now enter in "." first, will fill to "0." as in other columns
Moved Momentum Diagram down, slightly shrunk excess control panel area to fit
Momentum Diagram slider and +/- buttons given larger hit areas
Added spacing between rows in the "Data Table" area (more room for sliders)
Removed "Show Paths" feature
Increased hit-boxes around the slider knobs
Increased hit-boxes around play/restart/step/back buttons, balls, and their velocity targets
Removed flickering on the slider
Limited number of balls to a max of 3
Disabled grabbable control panels for ipad
Advanced tab: Improved performance when paused and dragging one of 5 balls.  Originally 1 frame per 10 sec, now 5fps or so
Centered slider knobs on the track
Pointed slider knobs down (to point at labels)
Moved labels so they don't interfere with larger slider knobs
Increased the size of slider knobs
Made control panel 20% bigger

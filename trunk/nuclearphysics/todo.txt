- Reset should remove containment vessel
- Disabling containment vessel should not reset.
- Set tabs to be same as background.
- Controlled Reaction module chews a lot of CPU.

- Location coords of ray gun and button are screwy.
- Add new standard About box
- "% Fissioned" isn't meaningful until you hit the Fire button.

- The ray gun image temporarily disappears during some fission events.
- If you resize the window before displaying the Single Nucleus Fision panel for the first time,
the elements on that panel will not be sized correctly.
- "% Fissioned" spinner on the Chain Reaction panel shows bogus numbers if you change the number
of nuclei in the play area after things have fissioned and before you hit the reset button.
- Now that the neutrons don't have tails when they are flying around, you can't see them in the
Controlled Reaction panel.


- profiles should not be created for all nuclei
- 2 graphics are being created for each model element because there are two physical panels per module.

- Refactor EnergyProfile so it's in model coordinates
- Don't need fision behavior in Polonium. Make a Fisionable interface.
- Profiled nucleus modules don't account properly for resizing before the first time they're activated

- AlphaDecay class specifically specifies the type of the daughter. This isn't good.
- Every nucleus is getting a Profile instance. They don't all need one!!!

?	anti Alias the text (if it i
s already anti-aliased, then the font needs changed.)That’s what it’s called to get the smoother look?
-   add standard CVS and PhET headers
-   Move some behavior from modules into the model
-   Area behind tabs is the wrong color in 1.5
-   "About" box is illegible, and mentions fusion
-   UI colors aren't initialized properly since modules defer their initialization

Alpha Radiation
- Rewind button is enabled before alph decay

Fission:
-   Obsolete Interface exception when running under 1.4.

Chain Reaction panel
?	The label “Controls” should be removed. … Wendy if this is to be done, it should be done on all the panels, which all say controls, but why take it out? Extra words – extra clutter, I’m not convinced that it adds anything.
- Bug ExplodingContainmentGraphic!!!! If I don't setIgnoreMouse(true), all mouse events continue to get eaten after
a reset.!!!!!


Controlled Reaction
?	The black looks like it’s the same stuff as the containment vessel.  Should be different if it’s not.



================
1.08.12
================
Chain Reaction panel
- Chain Reaction panel doesn't put all the nuclei you specify in the spiner into the container if it can't
find the place to put them, and it doesn't tell you why.
- Replace spinners with a sliders and text boxes
- Using standardized L&F
- Need a color selection option for control panel.
- Energy graphs are update more frequently, and the rate graph is scaled so it makes more sense.
- Color of rate graph is more visible

================
1.08.11
================
- % text field updates
- Reduced update period of vessel temperature updates by 20% for controlled chain reaction ( 0:15)
?	Can the Fire Neutron Button look like the button that is on the lasers in QWI?

- Remove Phet logo from control panel         (0:15)
- Split "Alpha particle energy" to two lines    (0:15)
- Instead of a Fire Neutron Button can we have a gun with a button that looks
like the button on the QWI gun that fires the neutrons. (2:00)
- percent U235 fissioned readout now correct in Chain Reaction panel (0:15)
- Chain Reaction panel doesn't function properly after vessel explodes (2:00)
- Nuclei are cleared from Chain Reaction panel when you show or hide the containment vessel (0:15)
- Label on rewind button reads "Rewind to decay"
- Memory leak fixed that bogged down Controlled Reaction panel
- Buttons for firing neutrons and enabling/disabling containment vessel are in play area
- Found workaround to deal with change in PhetTabbedPane that broke some code (1:30)
- changed units on bar charts on controlled chain reaction panel        (0:15)
- you can lower the control rods below the bottom of the vessel         (0:15)
- Total energy line on alpha decay panel stays put after alpha decay    (1:00)

- Panels save state properly when you tab away from and back to them    (0:45) 
- Single nucleus fission energy profile panel has a total energy line.  (1:00)
- Chain reaction panel
    - no orphaned nuclei are left after the containment vessel explodes.    (0:30)
- Controlled Chain Reaction panel
    - Added legend                                                          (0:15)
    - Fire Neutrons button is always enabled                                (0:15)
- Changed colors of energy profiles to conform to QT                        (0:15)

- kabooms are removed from simulation on rewind of alpha decay              (0:30)

- Put legends in properties

================
1.08.10
================
- The text labeling the graphs is very light and hard to read.
?	After a reaction the neutrons continue to fly out the left hand side. I’ve waited about 3 minutes and this hasn’t stopped.  There is not energy production rate so they should not continue to fly out.
?	In addition, the black container should block neutrons.
?	Checkboxes have had so-so success in interviews.  Let’s replace the Enable Containment Vessel check box with a button that says Containment Vessel. The button should be an on/off type button
- Implement Kathy's profile model
- Change to Polonium 211
- Calibrate time scale for alpha decay according to model
- Kabooms need to be rewirtten so they don't update when the clock is paused
- Containment blows up and fades

================
1.08.09
================
- rewind feature added

================
1.08.08
================
Alpha Decay
- Straighten out sign issues with total energy, min energy, max energy, etc., and their display sense in the profile panel
- Redesigned the energy profile panel
- change to polonium

Single Nucleus Fission
 - Energy profile appears in a pane floating on the apparatus panel



================
1.08.07
================
?	The Energy Graphs box pops up on the far top left corner of my screen and the sim is in a window that fills only part of my screen so I didn’t notice the graph until later.  (If you close it there is no way to get it back).  Also The Energy Graphs box does not go away when I change panes. To correct these problems Try putting the energy graph fixed in the lower portion of the play area below the chamber I would suggest the lower left if we are going to put it in the play area.
?	Maybe extend the blue so that the holder of the blue is below the black and we can see that they are connected.  This might help cue the user to the handle. Maybe move whole the vessel and handle over to the left a bit so handle isn’t so crowded.
?	Things move in this panel too fast also. I’d suggest half speed and we’ll look again.  It may need to be slower.

================
1.08.06
================
- After firing a neutron, disable Fire Neutron button until module is reset
- Controlled reaction works properly both before and after resets.

================
1.08.05
================
- Improved performance on Chain Reaction and Controlled Reaction modules.
- Slowed the clock for the Chain Reaction module.
- Startup of Controlled Reaction panel is very slow, and its performance is bad

================
1.08.03
================
- profile panel isn't centered properly relative to the upper panel

================
1.08.03
================
?	Should start up on first tab
?	Pause and Play settings stay where they are placed when you switch panes.  What has been changed in one pane should not affect the next pane. Is it possible that the sim is still moving the alpha particles around in the first pane while the user is looking at other panes since the play and pause buttons are all connected?
?	Remove help buttons since there is no help.
-   font for spinners is way too big in 1.5
?	Have the legend on each panel only display the applicable items to each tab.
-   Button labels are illegible in 1.5
?	You can’t see what the buttons (Reset, Help, Pause) say.  They look grayed out on my computer. In fact, the ‘grayed out’ play and step buttons are many times easier to read than the active play button.
?	Changed tabs so that they look like our new Tabs.


Alpha Radiation
?	The atoms bounce around to fast.  There speed needs cut down to 25% of it’s current speed and then we’ll look again
?	Change the label “Running time to decay (msec)” to “Time to decay” and can the units be placed with the number?
?	After the decay the alpha particle is moving around in the background instead of in the foreground.
?	The lower section should look like a graph sitting in the play area rather than more play area. During interviews all the students thought it was a physical representation and could not make sense out of it.  If it looks like a graph, it may go over better. Try making the axis lines more prominent also.
-   gridlines overlay the profile, and there's a label to further suggest it is a graph
?	In interviews students really wanted a rewind button or replay so that they could watch the decay happen again?  Is my recollection correct that this is not possible?

Fission:
?	Speed reduced to half.
?	Graph in lower portion as in Alpha Radiation panel
-   nucleus on graph pane of single nucleus fission module flashes

Chain Reaction panel
-   Neutron is fired from the same spot in the panel, regardless of the size of the vessel
-   Neutrons are either absorbed or reflected when they hit the containment vessel.
-   Nuclei are absorbed when them hit the containment vessel.
?	U239 should be what U238 turns into once they absorb a neutron.
?	Remove “Number of” and just have the label 235U nuclei (with spelling correction) as the label for each spinner.
?	Remove “Percent” put a % sign to the right of the box or better yet, in the box with the number so that it’s formatted the same as the number.
?	I would suggest a vessel that’s half as thick.
?	There’s a wierd little box that shows up around Enable Containment Vessel when you choose the check box but once you do something else in the control panel it disappears.
-   "Enable Containment Vessel" color isn't the same as the other labels in the panel
?	Once the Legend is reduced to the applicable items only and the Help button is removed, this should give more room for the controls.
-   % spinner acts unpleasant when a spinner is spun after a fission run

Controlled Reaction
?	The neutrons in this panel have tails and look like photons.  They should just be round balls.
-   The "hidden" U238 nuclei are now displayed because of the new listener mechanism for creating nucleus graphic

Historical  todos
=================
- Double daughters in reactor


- Frame doesn't always come up completely until you resize it
- Performance is very much frame-size dependent
- Single fission panel should work differently: Nucleus should jump to higher level instantaneously. The necking should
vibrate without the CM moving
- Fission products should have same momentum, not speed
- "Slow Motion" button
- Make NucleusGraphic a PhetImageGraphic for performance?
- percent fisioned text field isn't right while nuclei are being added
- kabooms need to be on a layer above the containment vessel
- listeners and leaveSystem() implementations are spread around in odd places
- is more than one kaboom being made per fission?

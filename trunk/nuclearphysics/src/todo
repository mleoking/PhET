- Spinner for placing nuclei doesn't increment even after some nuclei are placed.
- percent fisioned text field isn't right while nuclei are being added
- kabooms need to be on a layer above the containment vessel
- use NuclearBody interface and leaveSystem() instead of lists of graphics mapped to model elements.
- counters on multiple nucleus panel aren't right
- listeners and leaveSystem() implementations are spread around in odd places
- graphics don't scale
- is more than one kaboom being made per fission?

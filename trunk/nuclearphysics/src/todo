- Containment vessel should fade out after fission starts
- use NuclearBody interface and leaveSystem() instead of lists of graphics mapped to model elements.
- counters on multiple nucleus panel aren't right
- listeners and leaveSystem() implementations are spread around in odd places
- graphics don't scale
- tiled size of frame needs to be set
- is more than one kaboom being made per fission?

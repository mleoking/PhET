Mathematical symbols used throughout Fourier simulation:

A = amplitude
An = amplitude of nth harmonic
delta = change
f = function of time (or space, etc.)
F = function of frequency
lamda = wavelength
k = wave number
L = "string" length (if this were a plucked string)
m = mode or harmonic number
pi = pi
sigma = width of the gaussian packet (dx)
t = time
T = sampling period, or period of the 1st harmonic
omega = angular frequency
x = position in space along L
y = amplitude value

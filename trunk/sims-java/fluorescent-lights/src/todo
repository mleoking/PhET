- Move electron production controls to the play area
- Configurable element should have the same size panel as hydrogen

- remove the "Materials" strings from DischargeLamps.properties

- cache photons at angles. lots of time spent creating rotated images
- Turn off photon/atom collisions
- Atom hot spot is not correct
- Memory leak
- Figure out why energy levels panel needs a dialog around it to paint properly
- DischargeLampAtom should have configurable likelihood of dropping from a state to some other state

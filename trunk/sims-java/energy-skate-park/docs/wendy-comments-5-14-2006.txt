Sam,
1. Is it in your plans to add a warning box to the reset button that says,
Are you sure you want to reset everything?
2.  The scale for the readings on the path data is still way huge ever since
you resized the world. When I right click on a data point, I can just barely
see the bottom of some very huge numbers.
3.  Can the bar chart have a clear button also?  That's a really good way to
get rid of the out of control thermal energy.
4.  Also on the bar chart, there's a little minimize box which gets rid of
the chart within it's window but the window stays up.  I can't find where it
went to.  I tried clicking on the bar graph button on the control panel and
it does nothing. If I close the bar graph with the red x and then ask for it
again from the control panel it comes back up blank still.
5.  When I minimize my window for the entire simulation and bring it back
up, only the energy vs. position graph comes back with the sim and the other
two are gone.
6.  Is it possible to give the skater any velocity when he's in space?  I
thought there used to be a way but I can't figure it out.

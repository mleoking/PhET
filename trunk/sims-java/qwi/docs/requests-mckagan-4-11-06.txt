Get rid of help button.

Get rid of propagators control.

Ruler for photons has 900nm divided into 5 chunks, which is not easy to
use.  Can you make length of ruler a round number like 3000nm and have
it longer than box (box should still be 2700nm), like what you've done
with the ruler for electrons?

Right now when you rotate the ruler, it points down.  It would be
preferable for it to point up, so that it measures from where the
particles start rather than from where they end.  If this is easy to
change, do it.  If it's difficult, don't bother.

"Reset all" doesn't reset wavelength/velocity (or a lot of other
things).  Either name of button should be changed, or behavior should be
changed.  It shouldn't be called reset all if it doesn't actually reset
lots of things.

Speed of light is correct at low resolution, but is 2x too slow for
medium resolution and 4x too slow for high resolution.  To fix this,
clock should tick half as many times per time step for medium
resolution, and a quarter as many times for high resolution.

I measured electron speeds using clock and stopwatch for various speeds
(rows) and resolutions (columns) and they are really strange:
	Low	Medium	High
default	8333m/s	2703m/s	735m/s
Min	6250m/s	1961m/s	500m/s
Max	9090m/s	3390m/s	971m/s

I believe according to my calculations the min speed should be 920 m/s
and the max speed should be 1840 m/s.  This isn’t really consistent with
any of the speeds above.  If we can't figure this out quickly, let's not
worry about it, but could you tell me what value you're using for dt in
Richardson and whether it depends on resolution?

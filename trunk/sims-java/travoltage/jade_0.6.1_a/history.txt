____________________________________

2005-11-20
Release Alpha 0.6
- ParticleSystem class renamed to DynamicsEngine
- Instantiation of primitives/surfaces/constraints is no longer hidden by the DynamicsEngine interface
- RectangleTile added
- CircleSurface renamed to CircleTile
- Particle class is now an abstract base class and should not be instantiated directly
- Added RectangleParticle
- Added CircleParticle
- Collision depth of LineSegments can now be set with LineSegment.setCollisionDepth()
- Added onContact() event handler for surfaces
- Directories for different sections of the library
- Added LineSegment.setCollisionDepth() method
- The Wheel particle property has been removed. The Wheel object itself is now correctly a primitive.
- Added Wheel.setTraction();
- Removed LineSurface.setIsOrientH(), collision is handled correctly now
- ParticleSystem.setKfr() renamed to DynamicsEngine.setSurfaceBounce()
- ParticleSystem.setFriction() renamed to DynamicsEngine.setSurfaceFriction()
- Added setVisible() method to all paintable objects;
- Added setActiveState() and getActiveState() to Surfaces. Surfaces can now be de/activated this way.

"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- put proton behind field in Schrodinger, make 0 field values transparent
- cells should be centered on Schrodinger axes
- Schrodinger spontaneous emission should always emit photon from somewhere near 1sr Bohr orbit
- implement algorithm for Schrodinger (n,l,m) state transitions
- SchrodingerNode needs a ViewModelTransform, inverse of ModelViewTransform

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- get rid of HAController, merge into HAModule
- add "show traces" feature for alpha particles (need to interpolate curve between points)
- finish spectrometer interface (ticks/labels, compressed UV/IR ranges, layout fixes, setSize method, Java2D to draw interior)
- implement spectrometer model
- implement energy diagrams, reuse Ron's stuff
- add squiggles to energy diagrams showing the gun's light wavelength (as in Lasers sim)
- clear spectrometer when atomic model is changed
- update images on atom model selector buttons
- is ModelViewTransform used everywhere is should be in view?
- verify that behavior is correct when clock is paused
- decide on default values for all controls

LOW PRIORITY:
- improve performance of deBroglie "brightness" and "brightness magnitude" representations
- improve performance of deBroglie 3D representation
- Bohr gets jerky when you change wavelength (or just click in wavelength textfield) - Mac only?
- handle model-view transform differently?
- reduce size of image files that are being scaled down (eg, plum pudding)
- add WavelengthControl.setTrackSize(Dimension)
- add WavelengthControl.setKnobSize(Dimension)
- size "UV" and "IR" labels to fit WavelengthControl track height
- generate spectrum instead of using an image file
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in CursorHandler when you drag the cursor outside the play area, then back inside
- animate opening/closing of Atomic Model selection panel
- bug: spectrometer buttons are fully transparent on Win98
- generalize creating a "panel" node to fit under a collection of nodes
- fix problem with updating drag bounds of ConstrainedDragHandler, as used in WavelengthControl
- create layout nodes for creating Piccolo-based control panels
- rewrite AtomicModelSelector to use inner classes, or layout node
- cache Colors

REJECTED:
(12/14/06) - "atom destroyed" message with reset button for Solar System model (feature dropped)
(12/14/06) - "atom ionized" feature for Plum Pudding, Bohr, deBroglie, Schrodinger models (feature dropped)
(12/8/06) - make panel spacing and canvas spacing configurable via SimStrings file (waste of time)
(12/8/06) - white light sometimes gets in a state where UV photons are fired only at -x values (cannot reproduce)
(12/6/06) - design code to accommodate zoom controls on animation region (didn't do it, and will not have this feature)
(11/30/06) - generate white light photons based on electron's state? (just use transition wavelengths for state=1)
(11/16/06) - make electron a brighter blue (any light will be indistinguishable from neutron gray)
(11/16/06) - add "H emission spectrum" option to "white" and "monochrome" options for gun (weighted white light instead)
(11/7/06) - change global coordinate system so that atom is centered at the origin (not necessary, too destabilizing, code would not be general)
(11/6/06) - handle AlphaParticle orientation in AlphaParticleNode (not supported by Rutherford Scattering algorith, and Sam McKagan says not necessary)
(11/1/06) - use constructive geometry to create plum pudding shape that matches image file (approximate as an ellipse)
(10/5/06) - add zoom buttons to atom box so that it's supported (complicates implementation, unlikely feature)
(9/14/06) - design a gun control that shoots either one-shot or continuous (intensity controls do this)
(9/14/06) - delete intensity controls for gun (keep them)
(9/14/06) - configurable gun nozzle size, make it match height of black box (interface was changed)
(9/13/06) - bug: toggle buttons in atomic model selector get selected on mouseover, Windows, JDK 1.5.0_08 (got rid of toggle buttons)
(8/30/06) - port wavelength control from Photoelectric Effect sim (easier to rewrite)

"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- with new layout, what do I see when a photon is emitted? where is it emitted to?
- layout of canvas is kludgy
- all Piccolo text (PText, HTMLNode, PSwing) looks horrible on Windows
- add x-axis ticks and labels to spectrometer
- specify dimensions of spectrometer

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- bug: spectrometer buttons are fully transparent on Win98
- port spectrometer from Discharge Lamps sim
- show compresses UV and IR range in spectrometer (like in Discharge Lamps)
- when gun type or atomic model is changed, delete all photons & alpha particles, clear spectrometer
- canvas layout
- get model details from Sam McKagan & Mike Dubson
- ignore spectral line table entries with node>5 or wavelength outside [90,700] nm

LOW PRIORITY:
- generate spectrum instead of using an image file
- add ability to set dimensions of wavelength control
- add ability to set knob size of wavelength control
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in CursorHandler when you drag the cursor outside the play area, then back inside

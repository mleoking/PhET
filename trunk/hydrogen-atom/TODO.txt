"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- add model continuum control
- add experiment/prediction selection switch
- port spectrometer from Discharge Lamps sim

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- get model details from Sam McKagan
- ignore spectral line table entries with node>5 or wavelength outside [90,700] nm

LOW PRIORITY:
- generate spectrum instead of using an image file
- add ability to set dimensions of wavelength control
- add ability to set knob size of wavelength control
- add ability to set font for wavelength control

DONE:
(9/6/06) - hook up internal handlers in gun controls, to hide/show controls and set colors properly
(9/6/06) - add ability to set background/foreground color scheme for gun controls
(9/6/06) - rewrite gun control panels to be Piccolo nodes, not JPanels, so WavelengthControl can be added
(9/5/06) - click on wavelength control track to move to a value
(9/5/06) - bugfix: type a bogus value into wavelength control, it beeps but doesn't reset to previous value
(9/5/06) - clamp dragging of wavelength control to min/max range
(9/5/06) - test wavelength control with scale applied
(9/5/06) - enable range check for wavelength arg in WavelengthControl.setWavelength
(9/5/06) - fill wavelength control cursor with same color as knob
(9/5/06) - fix wavelength slider, cursor drags past minWavelength, can't reach maxWavelength (off by 3 nm)
(9/5/06) - integrate drag handling into wavelength control's ConstrainedDragHandler
(9/5/06) - consolidate/simplify UI update code for wavelength control
(9/5/06) - add cursor to wavelength control
(8/30/06) - move units outside textfield in wavelength control
(8/30/06) - set wavelength control range of 90-780 nm (far UV, no far IR)
(8/30/06) - WavelengthControl, a rewrite of spectrum slider for Piccolo
(8/29/06) - rewrite gun control panels
(8/29/06) - add "Gun Type" control (light or alpha particles)
(8/28/06) - continue fleshing out light gun controls
(8/25/06) - add control cable and control panel for gun
(8/25/06) - fix gun on/off button images
(8/25/06) - fix gun image
(8/24/06) - add basic gun graphic with on/off button
(8/24/06) - acquire gun image from QWI simulation, licensing cleared by Sam Reid
(8/24/06) - add custom clock control panel
(8/24/06) - create HAModule
(8/24/06) - create HAApplication
(8/10/06) - set up CVS commit notification
(8/10/06) - create JNLP and SimStrings files
(8/10/06) - set up project in CVS

REJECTED:
(8/30/06) - port wavelength control from Photoelectric Effect sim (easier to rewrite)

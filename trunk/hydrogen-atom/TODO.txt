"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- add close button to spectrometer, put "Show" button behind spectrometer
- add x-axis ticks and labels to spectrometer
- redo gun control panel
- make gun nozzle same size as side of black box (bigger gun? bigger nozzle?)
- bug: toggle buttons in atomic model selector get selected on mouseover (Windows, JDK 1.5.0_08)
- bug: spectrometer buttons are fully transparent on Win98
- port spectrometer from Discharge Lamps sim
- show compresses UV and IR range in spectrometer (like in Discharge Lamps)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- when gun type or atomic model is changed, delete all photons & alpha particles, clear spectrometer
- make control panels have rounded corners and textured backgrounds
- canvas layout
- get model details from Sam McKagan & Mike Dubson
- ignore spectral line table entries with node>5 or wavelength outside [90,700] nm

LOW PRIORITY:
- generate spectrum instead of using an image file
- add ability to set dimensions of wavelength control
- add ability to set knob size of wavelength control
- add ability to set font for wavelength control
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in CursorHandler when you drag the cursor outside the play area, then back inside

DONE:
(9/13/06) - tweak canvas layout
(9/13/06) - make black box significantly larger
(9/13/06) - make energy diagrams slightly narrower

(9/6/06) - add experiment/prediction mode switch
(9/6/06) - move contruction of control panels inside HAGunNode
(9/6/06) - hook up internal handlers in gun controls, to hide/show controls and set colors properly
(9/6/06) - add ability to set background/foreground color scheme for gun controls
(9/6/06) - rewrite gun control panels to be Piccolo nodes, not JPanels, so WavelengthControl can be added
(9/5/06) - click on wavelength control track to move to a value
(9/5/06) - bugfix: type a bogus value into wavelength control, it beeps but doesn't reset to previous value

"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- why don't PhotonNodes appear in the atom box?
- work out details of mapping between model and view coordinate systems (currently 1:1)

HIGH PRIORITY:
- generalize creating a "panel" node to fit under a collection of nodes
- add x-axis ticks and labels to spectrometer
- draw interior window of spectrometer using PPath
- fix spectrometer layout
- add SpectrometerNode.setSize(Dimension)
- add WavelengthControl.setTrackSize(Dimension)
- add WavelengthControl.setKnobSize(Dimension)
- size "UV" and "IR" labels to fit WavelengthControl track height

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- design code to accommodate zoom controls on animation region (possible feature)
- create layout nodes for creating Piccolo-based control panels
- rewrite AtomicModelSelector to use inner classes, or layout node
- port spectrometer from Discharge Lamps sim
- show compressed UV and IR range in spectrometer (like in Discharge Lamps)
- when gun type or atomic model is changed, delete all photons & alpha particles, clear spectrometer
- get model details from Sam McKagan & Mike Dubson
- ignore spectral line table entries with node>6
- handle AlphaParticle orientation in AlphaParticleNode
- handle Photon orientation in PhotonNode

LOW PRIORITY:
- make panel spacing and canvas spacing configurable via SimStrings file
- generate spectrum instead of using an image file
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in CursorHandler when you drag the cursor outside the play area, then back inside
- animate opening/closing of Atomic Model selection panel
- bug: spectrometer buttons are fully transparent on Win98

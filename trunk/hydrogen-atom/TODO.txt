"To Do" list for "The Hydrogen Atom" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- fix wavelength slider, cursor drags past minWavelength, can't reach maxWavelength (off by 3 nm)
- add cursor to wavelength control
- move units outside texfield in wavelength control
- add wavelength control to light control panel
- ignore spectral line table entries with node>5 or wavelength outside [90,700] nm
- port spectrometer from Discharge Lamps sim

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- get model details from Sam McKagan

LOW PRIORITY:

DONE:
(8/30/06) - set wavelength control range of 90-780 nm (far UV, no far IR)
(8/30/06) - WavelengthControl, a rewrite of spectrum slider for Piccolo
(8/29/06) - rewrite gun control panels
(8/29/06) - add "Gun Type" control (light or alpha particles)
(8/28/06) - continue fleshing out light gun controls
(8/25/06) - add control cable and control panel for gun
(8/25/06) - fix gun on/off button images
(8/25/06) - fix gun image
(8/24/06) - add basic gun graphic with on/off button
(8/24/06) - acquire gun image from QWI simulation, licensing cleared by Sam Reid
(8/24/06) - add custom clock control panel
(8/24/06) - create HAModule
(8/24/06) - create HAApplication
(8/10/06) - set up CVS commit notification
(8/10/06) - create JNLP and SimStrings files
(8/10/06) - set up project in CVS

REJECTED:
(8/30/06) - port wavelength control from Photoelectric Effect sim (easier to rewrite)

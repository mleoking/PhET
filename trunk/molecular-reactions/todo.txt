- Temperature control doesn't work properly
- Exceptions thrown when lots of molecules in the box
- Can't select a B type molecule
- Hose on pump graphic is aliased
- Hard bonds not always going away
- Temperature control will make model go crazy

- Clean up code by using AbstractMolecule.useFull<xxx> and AbstractMolecule.getFullMolecule()
- When the selected molecule is removed from the Complex module, the energy view still tracks it
- Icons images are truncated on right and bottom
- Move GraphicFactory classes out of SpatialView.
- Put bonds on the energy view

Collision Issues
================
- Energy isn't conserved
- Simple molecules sometimes get curving trajectories
- Energy profile must be keyed to components types of the composite
- spring constants must correspond to difference between profile floors
    and the peak

====
Bugs
====
- Provisional bonds should be based on the collision distance
- Hard collision in reaction isn't conservative
- Spring collision
    - Force must be infinite on contact
    - Collisions aren't conservative
    - Angular velocity shouldn't acrue in simple test. Should there be a floor on r?
- Should kinetic energy increase if compound molecule has lower floor?
- How should selection/higlighting work? Use CM instead of halo.

==========
Internal
==========
- Some objects that listen to SimpleMolecule.Listener.selectionStatusChanged() should
    listen instead to the SelectedMoleculeTracker.
- HardBodyCollision takes Molecules. It should take Body. Can't because it uses bounding box
    overlap test.
- Look at todo in CompositeMolecule.releaseSimpleMolecule()


==============
Features
==============

==============
Model features
==============
- simple molecule reactant must hit the simple molecule in the composite reactant that is
    going to remain in the composite product (i.e., the B molecule)
- Change to spring model for collision

===============
Model questions
===============
- How much kinetic energy should the component that was knocked off have?


=======
Done
=======
09-05-06 - MoleculeMoleculeCollisionAgent.createBond() is bad. It always uses the same molecule in the composite to bond to.
09-06-06 - add/remove molecules
09-06-06 - randomize adding molecules
09-08-06 - temperature control
09-11-06 - Provisional bonds fade in and out
09-11-06 - Don't allow user to add B molecules
09-11-06 - Allow user to add/remove AB and BC molecules
09-18-06 - Molecule counters should be spinners
09-23-06 - Created glass molecule graphics and box
09-24-06 - Removed B counter from control panel
09-24-06 - Molecules appear in the right place in the energy view, and are controlled by cursor bar
09-24-06 - Pump molecules into box with constrained directions of travel
09-25-06 - no markings on the molecules in Simple module
09-25-06 - Bonds shown on all composite molecules
- Add "Temperature Control" label
- Change "Add" and "Remove" to "Raise" and "Lower" on temperature control
09-26-06 - Molecules in energy view don't move under manual control
09-26-06 - Removed Bond[] from CompositeMolecule?
09-26-06 - Provisional bonds show up between bound molecules that they shouldn't
09-26-06 - Added reaction legends to bottom of panels
09-27-06 - Added borders around molecule type selection panels
09-27-06 - Added option to show/hide bonds
09-27-06 - Plugged memory leak on ProvisionalBond
10-03-06 - Springs in ProvidsionalBond are working, sort of, but base everything on the CM of
            the components of the bond, which isn't right. I need to determine attachment
            points, and base everything on them.
10-04-06 - Performance problem in A-BC-AB-C-Reaction.doReactionII
10-04-06 - Add axes to energy view
10-06-06 - Add launcher
10-11-06 - Provisional bonds not always going away.
10-11-06 - Separation arrow on energy monitor panel doesn't display properly when there is any selected molecule
10-11-06 - Modules have Reset All behavior, but are missing some elements of it.
10-12-06 - Reset All doesn't reset molecule type of pump
10-12-06 - Radio buttons don't always properly reflect movement type of launcher after a reset
10-12-06 - After reset, selected molecule isn't right.
10-13-06 - molecules escaping box
10-13-06 - halo isn't shown for selected molecule
10-13-06 - CM marker isn't shown for nearest-to-selected molecule

10-20-06 - Bug in SelectedM
10-24-06 - Closing the chart dialogs should uncheck the check boxes
10-24-06 - Reaction happens when total energy is less than peak in Simple module.
    Ke of reactants wasn't being computed properly

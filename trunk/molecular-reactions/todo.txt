Collision Issues
================
- Energy isn't conserved
- Simple molecules sometimes get curving trajectories
- Energy profile must be keyed to components types of the composite
- spring constants must correspond to difference between profile floors
    and the peak

Bugs
====
Spring collision
    - Force must be infinite on contact
    - Collisions aren't conservative
    - Angular velocity shouldn't acrue in simple test. Should there be a floor on r?            
- Amount of energy needed to get to reaction is delta from floor, not absolute value
- Should kinetic energy increase if compound molecule has lower floor?
- How should selection/higlighting work? Use CM instead of halo.
- Composite molecules should have specified space between the components

==========
Internal
==========
- Some objects that listen to SimpleMolecule.Listener.selectionStatusChanged() should
    listen instead to the SelectedMoleculeTracker. 
- HardBodyCollision takes Molecules. It should take Body. Can't because it uses bounding box
    overlap test.
- Look at todo in CompositeMolecule.releaseSimpleMolecule()
- Is Bond[] needed in CompositeMolecule?


==============
Features
==============
- temperature control

==============
Model features
==============
- simple molecule reactant must hit the simple molecule in the composite reactant that is
    going to remain in the composite product (i.e., the B molecule)
- Change to spring model for collision

===============
Model questions
===============
- How much kinetic energy should the component that was knocked off have?

09-11-06 - Provisional bonds fade in and out
09-11-06 - Don't allow user to add B molecules
09-11-06 - Allow user to add/remove AB and BC molecules
09-06-06 - add/remove molecules
09-06-06 - randomize adding molecules
09-05-06 - MoleculeMoleculeCollisionAgent.createBond() is bad. It always uses the same molecule in the composite to bond to.

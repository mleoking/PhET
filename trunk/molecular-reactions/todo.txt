Bugs
====
- Amount of energy needed to get to reaction is delta from floor, not absolute value
- Should kinetic energy increase if compound molecule has lower floor?
- How should selection/higlighting work? Use CM instead of halo.
- Composite molecules should have specified space between the components

==========
Internal
==========
- HardBodyCollision takes Molecules. It should take Body
- Look at todo in CompositeMolecule.releaseSimpleMolecule()

==============
Features
==============
- Don't allow user to add B molecules
- Allow user to add/remove AB and BC molecules 
- temperature control
- randomize adding molecules

==============
Model features
==============
- simple molecule reactant must hit the simple molecule in the composite reactant that is
    going to remain in the composite product (i.e., the B molecule)
- Change to spring model for collision

===============
Model questions
===============
- How much kinetic energy should the component that was knocked off have?


=======
Done
=======
09-05-06 - MoleculeMoleculeCollisionAgent.createBond() is bad. It always uses the same molecule in the composite to bond to.
09-06-06 - add/remove molecules

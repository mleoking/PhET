- Losing B molecule in tracker
- Thermometer
- Wiggle me: Pull to Launch
- If there are a lot of molecules in the box, the energy view throws an exception sometimes when
    neither the selected molecule nor the nearest molecule are part of a composite. This may be because
    things are in the middle of a time step.

- 1D in Simple module becomes 2D over time
- Components of CompositeMolecule in molecule tracker aren't next to each other
- Make font on energy pane bigger
- A molecule got outside the box today
- Exceptions thrown when lots of molecules in the box
- Can't select a B type molecule
- Hose on pump graphic is aliased
- Hard bonds not always going away

- Clean up code by using AbstractMolecule.useFull<xxx> and AbstractMolecule.getFullMolecule()
- When the selected molecule is removed from the Complex module, the energy view still tracks it
- Icons images are truncated on right and bottom
- Move GraphicFactory classes out of SpatialView.
- Put bonds on the energy view

Collision Issues
================
- Energy isn't conserved
- Simple molecules sometimes get curving trajectories
- Energy profile must be keyed to components types of the composite
- spring constants must correspond to difference between profile floors
    and the peak

====
Bugs
====
- Provisional bonds should be based on the collision distance
- Hard collision in reaction isn't conservative
- Spring collision
    - Force must be infinite on contact
    - Collisions aren't conservative
    - Angular velocity shouldn't acrue in simple test. Should there be a floor on r?
- Should kinetic energy increase if compound molecule has lower floor?
- How should selection/higlighting work? Use CM instead of halo.

==========
Internal
==========
- Some objects that listen to SimpleMolecule.Listener.selectionStatusChanged() should
    listen instead to the SelectedMoleculeTracker.
- HardBodyCollision takes Molecules. It should take Body. Can't because it uses bounding box
    overlap test.
- Look at todo in CompositeMolecule.releaseSimpleMolecule()


==============
Features
==============

==============
Model features
==============
- simple molecule reactant must hit the simple molecule in the composite reactant that is
    going to remain in the composite product (i.e., the B molecule)
- Change to spring model for collision

===============
Model questions
===============
- How much kinetic energy should the component that was knocked off have?


=======
Done
=======
09-05-06 - MoleculeMoleculeCollisionAgent.createBond() is bad. It always uses the same molecule in the composite to bond to.

09-27-06 - Added option to show/hide bonds
09-27-06 - Plugged memory leak on ProvisionalBond
10-03-06 - Springs in ProvidsionalBond are working, sort of, but base everything on the CM of
            the components of the bond, which isn't right. I need to determine attachment
            points, and base everything on them.
10-04-06 - Performance problem in A-BC-AB-C-Reaction.doReactionII
10-04-06 - Add axes to energy view

10-20-06 - Bug in SelectedM
10-24-06 - Closing the chart dialogs should uncheck the check boxes

    Ke of reactants wasn't being computed properly

10-26-06 - Temperature control doesn't work properly
10-26-06 - Remove "Time" from bar chart, and put icons for molecules
10-26-06 - Pie chart need legend
10-27-06 - Changed the max value on the bar chart to 20.

10-27-06 - Track a molecule feature causes the program to freeze if you hit the track a
    molecule button a second time.
10-27-06 - Y axis of bar chart needs smaller scale
10-27-06 - If you press select a molecule and then change to pie chart, the separation action
    is still visible in the pie chart window. The molecule stays selected when you
    go to bar or none too, but the separation window is not visible.

10-30-06 - If a molecule is selected in the Complex module and "None" is selected for upper pane,
    the selected molecule still appears
10-30-06 - With just a few molecules, added heat. Then reset. Exception thrown on reset. Problem was
    I was trying to remove graphics that were null from the energy view.
10-30-06 - Temperature control doesn't work after reset.
11-01-06 - Strip chart dialog should not be resizable
11-01-06 - Change order of pie slices
11-01-06 - Profile shouldn't be manipulable on the Simple panel. Also, profile should be constrained by the
    black panel.
11-01-06 - Profile should be fixed by default on Complex module. Add a check box for "design your
    own reaction."
11-01-06 - Make vertical axis for strip chart "number"
11-01-06 - Make vertical axis for bar chart "number"
11-01-06 - "Rescale" button on the strip chart
11-01-06 - Make things resizable
11-01-06 - Molecule counter in control panel can get off. Try putting in some molecules, then spinning them out.
    Put in 2 As. Pause. Put 0 in the spinner, hit enter and it goes to -1
11-01-06 - Clicking on a molecule graphic under the pump should select that radio button
11-01-06 - C segment on pie chart is sometimes wrong. If you put in just AB and BC molecules, the chart
    shows Cs.

- Energy view shows molecules spearated by the dist between their CMs. It
    should show distance between edgges of molecules.

- Only molecules of different type should be able to combine.

- Reason why nearestToTrackedMolecule gets lost when it becomes part of a composit molecule:
    It is taken out of the model while it's part of the composite molecule!

- HardBodyCollision takes Molecules. It should take Body
- Look at todo in CompositeMolecule.releaseSimpleMolecule()

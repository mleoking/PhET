Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: 10/04/05 - 10/10/05 (Tue-Mon)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Fourier simulation:
    o added a volume slider to control sound level
    o fixed misc bugs
    o disabled clock controls in panels where they're not relevant
    o published version 2.1 to PhET website
    o implemented "Wave Game" panel
    o published 2.1.1
    o started working on "Save" and "Load" features

WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  o continue work on Fourier (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/fourier/TODO.txt)

ISSUES:

  o The Fourier "Wave Game" is very difficult. What should we do about it?
  o Since the "Wave Game" is so difficult, should we still do the "Optical Pulse Shaper" sim?
  o Is the Fourier "Sound" module in or out?

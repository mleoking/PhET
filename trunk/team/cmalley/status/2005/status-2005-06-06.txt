ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Fourier simulation:
    o reviewed the requirements changes
    o made all modifications to the "Discrete" module Control Panel
    o use preset colors for harmonics instead of spreading them across the visible spectrum
    o noted that the specified harmonics colors are not "colorblind friendly"
    o experimented with the PhET "charts" package
    o started converting all existing graphs/waveforms to use the charts package
    o added horizontal zoom control
    
  Color Vision simulation:
    o reviewed new requirements (Help, MegaHelp, Challenge Me)
  
  charts package:
    o identified new features required by Fourier
    o worked with Sam to implement new features
    o misc additions and fixes
    
  phetcommon:
    o debug Control Panel on Macintosh
    o debug performance problem with Shape graphics on all platforms
    
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  o continue work on Fourier (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/fourier/TODO.txt)

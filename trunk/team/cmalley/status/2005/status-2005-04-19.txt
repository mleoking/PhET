Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Wed 4/13/05 - Tue 4/19/05

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
    
  Faraday simulation:
    o published v0r23 and v0r24
    o implemented and debugged a new model for the electromagnet
    o added the ability to draw the shape of any magnet model
    o increased the number of B-field sample points on the pickup coil
    o added a "Reset" button to all modules
    o enhanced compass so that it still appears to rotate when kinematics if off
    o ensure that field meter angles are always in the range -180...180 degrees
    o made the compass grid appear to be inside the coils
    o misc bug fixes
    o misc internal code changes and simplifications

  Fourier simulation:
    o nothing
  
  phetcommon:
    o tested stuff that was merged into trunk, identified problems and missing files
    
WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - continue work on Faraday (see "To Do" list at http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/faraday/todo.txt)

ISSUES:

  - none

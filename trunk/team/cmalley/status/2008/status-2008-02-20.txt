Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Feb 14-20, 2008 (Thu-Wed)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Glaciers:
  - fix glacial budget meter, it should use the meter's elevation, not the valley floor elevation
  - discuss climate model revisions with Archie
  - change climate control panels to support new climate model
  - change "Snowfall & Temperature" controls to: snowfall, snowfall reference elevation, sea-level temperature
  - change "Mass Balance" controls to: max snowfall, ELA
  - make all climate controls sliders, with editable textfield
  - implement conversions from ELA to temperature and snowfall reference elevation
  - disable ELA slider so we can see ELA range (there are circularity problems with mapping between the 2 climate domains)
  - display equilibrium line as a dashed horizontal that spans the play area (temporary representation)
  - fix -0 (negative zero) displays
  - display elevation and distance with precision=1, all other quantities with precision=0.1
  - fix some control panel layout problems (still not perfect)
   - update climate continuously while dragging sliders, performance is OK
  - published 0.00.06
  - discuss issues and possible new model approach with Archie
  
  Misc:
  - provide Eclipse configuration info to Geri Dow
  - investigate making ProGuard output less verbose
  
WHAT'S NEXT:

  - continue work on Glaciers, see:
    http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/TODO-glaciers.txt?view=markup
    
  - experiment with Trac and Bugzilla as possible replacements for Unfuddle
  
  - design for next phase of Translation Utility
     
ISSUES:

  - none
  
DATES UNAVAILABLE:

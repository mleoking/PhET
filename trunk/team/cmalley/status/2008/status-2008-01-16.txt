Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Jan 10-16, 2008 (Thu-Wed)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Glaciers:
  - created JUnit tests for model-view transforms
  - resolved all issues with cameras and transforms
  - added GPS Receiver tool for debugging purposes
  - rendered the valley contour using the provided model
  - scaled axes so that the entire valley (from x=0-80000 meters) is visible in the birds-eye view
  - added "dirt" texture to the valley to demonstrate issues with texture mapping
  - hooked up a basic climate controls (temperature and snowfall) to the model
  - clean up and javadoc
  - published 0.00.01
  
  build process:
  - had yet-another bad experience trying to use the build process, wasted a lot of time, could not deploy glaciers
  - reviewed Sam's process for deploying a translation
  - discussed terminology inconsistencies that make the build process difficult to understand
  - discussed the merits and drawbacks of separate JAR files for on-line and off-line
    
  hiring:
  - reviewed 15 applications, discussed with Sam Reid
  - ranked applicants
  
WHAT'S NEXT:

  - continue work on Glaciers, see:
    http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/TODO-glaciers.txt?view=markup
 
  - review job applications, assist with interviews
   
  - provide an estimate for adding SVG (vector graphics) support

  - discuss future work on Translation Utility
  
  - look at states-of-matter sim
  
  - work on debugging and cleaning up the build process?
  
ISSUES:

  - build-process: I've had nothing but problems using it. Should I get involved?
  - Glaciers: need model details asap
  - Glaciers: achieving the visualization requirements is going to be difficult and expensive
             (3D perspective, objects in cross-section, objects on surface, textures, lighting, quality at different scales, etc.)

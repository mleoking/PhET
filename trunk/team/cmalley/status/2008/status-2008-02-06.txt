Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Weekly Status Report

PERIOD: Jan 31 - Feb 6, 2008 (Thu-Wed)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  Glaciers:
  - various phone calls with Archie, questions about model
  - tweak equilibrium line model, allow equilibrium line to be at x < 0
  - tweak climate model to work with absolute temperature, versus temperature offset from modern times
  - add ice volume flux, length, terminus, and ice thickness to glacier model
  - add ice velocity model, use speed for velocity magnitude, use valley floor slope for direction
  - add glacier ice view, note performance issues (will need to compute thickness and velocity on a 1-D grid)
  - connect ice thickness tool to the model
  - add first part of timescale model
  - shorten visible name of ice thickness tool (as requested)
  - change canvas background color to "sky blue", so that white glacier is clearly visible
  
  Translation Utility:
  - brief look at LaunchPad
  
  Misc:
  - create Unfuddle tickets for problems reported by Sam McKagan from Uganda trip
  - update sim-template: use Listener pattern, better MVC separation, simplify controls
  
WHAT'S NEXT:

  - continue work on Glaciers, see:
    http://phet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phet/trunk/simulations-java/simulations/glaciers/TODO-glaciers.txt?view=markup
 
  - design for next phase of Translation Utility
     
  - provide an estimate for adding SVG (vector graphics) support
  
ISSUES:

  - none
  
DATES UNAVAILABLE:

  March 10-17
  July 28 - August 11

Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Status Report

PERIOD: September 13-19, 2012

Graphing Lines
- design meeting with AP to critique "Graph the Line" challenges and discuss "Make the Equation" challenges
- design meeting with team (minus KP) to confirm game decisions
- added ability to make x1 or y1 interactive independently in equations
- allow user to interact with game challenge when they got it wrong and correct answer is shown
- major overhaul of static and interactive equations to support typical "simplified" equations
- change request: vertically center slope sign on equals sign, add vertical offset parameter so we can tweak
- draw "+" and "-" instead of using fonts to facilitate vertical alignment and make "-" look better on Windows

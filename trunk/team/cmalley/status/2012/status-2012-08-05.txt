Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Status Report

PERIOD: July 26 - August 5, 2012

Line Graphing
- We had a design meeting and agreed on a set of challenges (and variations) to proceed with.
- Started refactoring some code to support game.
- Have not yet identified a Game framework that I'm happy with, still mulling this over.

Plate Tectonics
- completed code review, waiting for JO to follow up (#3386)

Normal Modes
- completed code review, waiting for MD to follow up (#3362)

Tablets
- Participated in discussion of how to proceed with tablet development (#3398).
  My opinion is that parallel iOS and Andriod development will be the highest
  quality and (in the long run) least-cost option. And the emphasis should be
  on creating a next generation of sims, not on porting exiting sims.

Administrative
- status meeting
- Physics/Math meeting

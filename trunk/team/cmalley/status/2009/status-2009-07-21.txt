  titration:
  - design meeting to discuss model issues
  
  glaciers:
  - met with Wendy about change requests

  - #1732, added "Clear container" button
  - #1740, gray out spinner text fields when they are not editable
  - #1741, use spinners for setting initial molecules counts
  - #1728, limit initial molecule counts to 100 of each type

Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Status Report

PERIOD: June 1-14, 2010 (Wed-Mon)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

Acid-Base Solutions:
- implemented model
- implemented basic versions of all control panels
- reused many elements from Magnifying Glass prototype
- adapted molecules view from prototype
- adapted concentration bar graph from advanced-acid-base-solutions
- design discussions with Kelly
- published 0.00.09, 0.00.10, 0.00.11
- in good shape for Kelly's interviews deadline (6/21/10)

Capacitor Lab:
- no progress, on hold to meet Acid-Base deadline

common:
- removed white border around phetcommon buttons, #2396
- discussed Save/Load enforement of .xml extension, #2404
 
 Translation Utility:
 - discuss web-based sim translation editor, #2388
 - investigated issue with Translation Utility window size on multi-display systems, #2406
  
 mis sims:
 - discuss how to organize motion-series, #2387
 - confirmed sound fix on Mac, #2386
 - fixed artifact in sound control panel, #2389
 - discussed Scala issues related to motion-series
 - discussed name for new version of The Ramp, #2054
 - reported wiggle-me problem in motion-2d, #2401
 - reported bogus Save/Load menu items in Lac Operon, #2403
  
 misc:
 - review Sam's example code documentation, #2347
 - resolved customer issue with PhET installation on Mac, #2352 
 - discussed issue of allowing older sim version to be accessed from website, #2400
 - resolved another customer issue with PhET installation on Mac, #2402

WHAT'S NEXT:

 - Acid-Base Solutions design & implementation 
 - Capacitor Lab design & implementation 
 - Faraday fix for dipole magnet, #2236 (waiting for info from Mike)
 - Lasers fix for lifetime sliders, #2190 (waiting for instructions from Kathy)

ISSUES:

 - We haven't received feedback on Acid-Base Solutions design from the Chem Advisory Board, and 
   I'm now 60% done with the sim.  Given our experience with the previous Acid-Base sim, this concerns me.

DATES UNAVAILABLE:

  June 14-24
  July 24-31
  August 1-6

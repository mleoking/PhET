Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.) - Status Report

PERIOD: Mon 10/11/04 - Fri 10/15/04

HOURS: 33.0 (7.5 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 9.5)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

  - wrote an example Flash program ("wiggler") to demonstrate that Flash
    is not capable of handling the 2D drawing requirements of the 
    Color Vision simulation.  Used this as the basis for abandoning
    Flash and resuming the port to Java.
  - started porting Flash code to Java, reused some of what Ron had 
    already ported
  - still learning my way around the PhET architecture, asked Ron a 
    bunch of questions to make sure I have a correct understanding of 
    how to put together a simulation
  - completed a substantial portion of the "RGB Bulb" module, including
    the photon beams.  Hooked up some JSliders to the photon beams and
    verifed that the user interface remains responsive when a large 
    number of photons are being drawn

WHAT'S NEXT:
 
  - finish remaining portions of "RBG Bulb" module, including:
      o change thought bulb color
      o create "color gradient" sliders for bulb intensity control
      o clean up images and placement of objects on apparatus
  - all of "Single Bulb" module still to be done

ISSUES:

  - none

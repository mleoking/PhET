Here's my process for building and publishing a simulation:

1. note the SVN revision number of the repository
2. edit the version properties in data/simname/simname.properties
3. run the eclipse/*.jardesc file from Eclipse to create the unprocessed JAR
4. run the proguard/*.pro file from ProGuard to create the processed JAR
5. scp the processed JAR to spot.colorado.edu
6. move the processed JAR to the proper subdirectory in spot:/htdocs/physics/phet/dev/

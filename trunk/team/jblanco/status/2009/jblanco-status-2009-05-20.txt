Radiometric Dating Game – 28.5 hrs

•	Worked with Sam on making the transforms more correct and usable so that the detection location of the datable items is correct.
•	Added the ability to rotate the images used for the datable items.
•	Made the distinction between the decay rates for Uranium vs. Carbon more apparent.
•	Made it possible to select the element type on the first two tabs by clicking the image of the element, and not just the radio button (UI suggestion from Chris M).
•	Positioned the datable items roughly as shown in the spec.  Set it up so that Noah P can finalize this as well as the ages of the items.
•	Fixed issues with displaying uranium decay on graph on 2nd tab.
•	Implemented bucket with slider (or button) for adding/removing nuclei from the 2nd tab.
•	Made the probe detect when it comes in contact with datable items.
•	Added the cable between the probe and the meter.
•	Added the selection panel to the dating meter for the different radiometric elements.

Alpha Decay – 3.0 hrs

•	Fixed an issue reported by a translator where some strings were not translatable (#1660).
•	Cleaned up a bunch of other TODO items that I had left in the code.

Installer & Web Site – 1.5 hrs

•	Added option to main rebuild script to allow it to deploy to web site after building, using this now in weekly automatic rebuild.
•	Worked with Marj to test this week's automatically built installers.  They look good, and have also been passed on to Linda Wellman.

KSU Installer - 12.0

•	Get the basic functions working on Figaro.
•	Worked with Jonathan on an issue that was causing near-infinite recursion in the ripping process.
•	Investigated issue about whether translated jars should be included with KSU installer (this would significantly increase the size of the installer).  Waiting for resolution on this.
•	Modified the way in which flash sim resources are downloaded so that directory access can be disabled (this is simpler and more secure).
•	Worked with Jonathan to set up a user-agent ID for the ripper that will allow the web site to recognize that it is the installer-builder and modify its pages accordingly.
•	Lots of iteration on creating local and web mirror installers, testing them, fixing issues, etc.
•	Current status is that we are able to create an Arabic version of the installer.  There is still some work to be done on the Distribution Tag and on embedding the local mirror installers within the web mirror installer, but we’re getting pretty close to being done with this for now.

Neuron - 9.0

•	Added ability for particles to move across the membranes through the leak channels.
•	Discussed elements of the specification with Noah P.
•	Implemented an improved approach for handling removal of channels from canvas (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Added the control panels for controlling the number of channels on the membrane (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Added the capability for membrane channels to be added and removed and hooked this to the control panel.
•	Integrated a background graphic created by Noah P with the intent of creating a looks of "depth" to the cross section.  After review by Noah, this was later removed.
•	Published to dev and solicited feedback.

Radioactive Dating Game – 1.5 hrs

•	Made a fix to the name of a datable item (Requested by Noah P).
•	Worked with Noah P to adjust the ages and positions of the datable items based on the feedback that we got from the geology dept.
•	Reposted the updated version to the production server.

Web Site and (non-KSU) Installer - 4.0 hrs

•	Posted better PDF of the PhET Design Process on the web site.
•	Investigated some differences reported by Wendy concerning the list of papers shown on the research page.
•	Followed up on some issues with the weekly build of the installers.  This turned out to be another case of exceeding our disk quota on this machine.  I have recommended expanding quota until we migrate to Figaro.
•	Made some changes to the installer-builder so that it would use less disk space.

Miscellaneous - 1.5

•	Hooked up a UPS provided by Sam R to phet-server.  We should now have about 30 minutes of backup time.
•	Verified some fixes made by Chris M to the translation utility.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 4.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation and Holidays - 8.0 hrs

•	Took Friday, September 18th, as a vacation day.

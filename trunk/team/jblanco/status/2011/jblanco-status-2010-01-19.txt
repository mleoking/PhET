•	Added photons to the selector buttons.
•	Added back the energy buttons (after review by Chemistry Team) and changed and relocated the captions.
•	Fixed issues with the photon images.
•	Lowered the maximum emission rate (when slider is all the way to the right).
•	Added initial version of a spectrum that can be displayed with a button push.
•	Investigated an issue with the slider knobs being very small on Windows Vista and Windows 7.
•	Posted a version to dev for review.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 6.0 hrs

•	Fixed a problem with deployment of prototype version to dev server.
•	Reviewed with Chemistry Team, circulated notes from meeting.
•	Added chemical symbol and a control for showing/hiding it.
•	Added abundance indicator and a control for showing/hiding it.

Build an Atom - 4.5 hrs

•	Worked with Sam R on documenting and some minor refactoring of the code based on Chris M’s code review comments, see #2650.  This task is complete except for one follow-up item that is being tracked in Unfuddle, see #2680.

Lac Operon - 1.0 hrs

•	Posted version containing fix for untranslatable strings, updated bug, notified the customer that originally reported the bug, see #2659.

Customer Support - 1.0

•	Investigated report of partial Arabic translations of the Nuclear Physics sims, discussed with Kathy, emailed Hisham suggesting that he prioritizes translation of the partially translated sims in this family (Alpha Decay, Beta Decay, and Radioactive Dating Game).

Sim Sharing Feature - 0.5

•	Started dialog with IT to open up ports on phet-server to support development, testing, and demonstration of this feature.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.

•	January 18th was taken as mostly vacation due to being unexpectedly stranded in the mountains.

What’s Next

•	Work on 2nd tab of the Isotopes sim.
•	Work on changes to Molecules and Light based on recent interviews.
•	Collaborate with Kathy on the design of some new biology simulations.
•	Research and order new PC.

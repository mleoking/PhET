PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
March 16, 2011

Time period covered: March 10th through March 16th.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 25.5 hrs

•	Changed appearance of element label on the first tab.
•	Took out the confirmation dialog for Reset All on the first tab.
•	Made the sliders look reasonable (they were crude prototypes last week).
•	Reviewed with Chemistry Team and made a list of recommended changes.
•	Got sliders working to add/remove particles.
•	Revised the positioning algorithm for the isotope controllers (buckets and sliders).
•	Fixed issues with dangling isotopes in buckets not moving into place.
•	Refactored and restructured code in preparation for adding stateful behavior.
•	Implemented the stateful behavior for switching between elements, interactivity modes, and mix type (user's mix versus nature's mix).
•	Added Reset All button and associated functionality for 2nd tab.
•	Added Clear Box button and associated functionality for 2nd tab.
•	Improved layout of 2nd tab.
•	Published a snapshot version for review, see http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/build-an-atom/2.01.02/

Build a Molecule - 6.0 hrs

•	Met with Emily M, Kelly L, Jonathan O, and Sam R to brainstorm and draw up ideas for the design.
•	Cleaned up sketches from meeting, created additional sketches based on notes.
•	Circulated sketches for review and for inclusion into specification.

Bending Light - 1.0 hrs

•	Collaborated with Sam R on improvements and fixes for the tool behavior, particularly with respect to Reset All.

Gene Machine: Protein Synthesis - 0.5

•	Added notes from dialog with Mike Klymkowski to the specification.

Sim Sharing - 0.5

•	Contacted IT about firewall exceptions not working, they forwarded my question to CU IT Security, and I have not heard back.
•	Did some testing with Sam R.

Common Code - 1.0

•	Read through issue about VoidFunction and added some thoughts (Unfuddle #2776).

Miscellaneous - 0.5

•	Investigated resources for color blindness.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Out all next week, taking March 21st through March 24th as vacation and March 25th is a holiday.

What’s Next

•	Continue design of Protein Synthesis simulation.
•	Continue design of Build a Molecule simulation.
•	Finish implementing Isotopes sim, publish versions for review and possibly for interviews.
•	Follow up on Chris M's review of Molecules & Light code.

Time period covered: February 3rd through February 9th.

Molecules and Light - 15.0 hrs

•	Modified the appearance of the frequency-changing wave, made it easy to adjust via parameters in the source code (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Fixed orientation of the visible portion of the spectrum.
•	Made the spectrum window disappear if visible and return to its original location on a Reset All.
•	Reviewed changes with the Chemistry Group.
•	Reviewed and commented on teaching tips.
•	Added feature that allows the background to be turned white.
•	Prototyped feature where diatomic oxygen vibrates after ozone breaks apart (ended up not adding this).
•	Cleaned up some internationalization.
•	Published a release candidate for review.
•	Separated this sim from Greenhouse - it is now a standalone simulation (in collaboration with Sam).
•	Fixed credits.
•	Extensive testing.
•	Published this sim to the production server (process is not quite complete yet).

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 5.75 hrs

•	Worked on design, implementation plan, and implementation of the 2nd tab.
•	Added isotope test chamber to the model, got it to appear on the screen.
•	Worked on making the periodic table universal enough to be used on this canvas.

Greenhouse - 3.0 hrs

•	Fixed bug with the oxygen slider on the Build Atmosphere portion of the Photon Absorption tab, see #2713.
•	Fixed bug with the appearance of methane on the Photon Absorption tab, see #2712.
•	Regression testing, since this sim had the Molecules and Light flavor removed.

Membrane Channels - 2.0 hrs

•	Published a version with the latest phetcommon code for review.
•	Fixed text alignment issue on the buttons (required regeneration of the icons on the buttons).

Sim Sharing - 0.25 hrs

•	Followed up on getting firewall exceptions in place for needed ports on phet-server.

Common Code - 2.5 hrs

•	Changed PieChartNode such that slices with 0 value are not shown at all.
•	Discussed BAA game architecture with Chris and how it might be reused in his current sim.
•	Tested KSU splash screens and credits at Chris' request.  Deployed and tested two Java sims and one Flash sim.

Installers - 1.5 hrs

•	Worked with Jonathan O to set up an installer builder that rips from phet-server and allows him to test changes to the  development web site.

Flash vs. Flex - 1.0

•	Discussed pros and cons of Flash vs. Flex development with Mike D.

Environment - 2.0

•	Updated notebook and bug that describes the Unfuddle Notifier, see #2654.
•	Worked on getting a new code signing certificate, since the current one expires 2/9/2011.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 7.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Updated the sim-pipeline document.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Nothing on the immediate horizon.

What’s Next

•	Create new abundance indicator for the 1st tab of the Isotopes sim.
•	Finish implementing initial version of 2nd tab of the Isotopes sim.
•	Collaborate with Kathy on the design of some new biology simulations.
•	Research and order new PC.

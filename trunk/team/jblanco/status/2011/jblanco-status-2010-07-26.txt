PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
July 26th, 2011

Time period covered: July 20th through July 26th.

Balance and Torque - 15.0 hrs

•	Implemented the fulcrum with higher center of balance.
•	Improved the look and behavior of the fulcrum with higher center (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Discussed physics and general approach to model with Trish L.
•	Improved physics so that plank will return to balanced position when masses are positioned at equal distances from the center.
•	Fixed an issue where the masses could be slightly off from the allowed positions if added when the plank was tilted.
•	Spent a few minutes trying to create a girl for the balance.

Gene Expression Basics - 15.0 hrs

•	Added infrastructure for adding and removing biomolecules using the tool box.
•	Made RNA polymerase look more like the spec.
•	Added tool box for first gene.
•	Added initial cut of all biomolecules to the first tool box.
•	Created an observable list, need to discuss with other developers if this would be useful for common code.
•	Cleaned up, refactored, removed unused code.

Environment - 3.0 hrs

•	Downgraded to IntelliJ 10.5 to work around issue with presentation compiler.
•	Migrated email account to the exchange server.

Installers - 0.5 hrs

•	Tested installer to verify changes requested in #2889, all looked good.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.5 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Discussion with Ariel about Mathnasium.
•	Weekly status report.
•	Reviewed, prioritized, and updated Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

What’s Next

•	Continue developing Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue developing Balance & Torque simulation.

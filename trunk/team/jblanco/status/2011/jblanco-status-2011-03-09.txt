PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
March 9, 2011

Time period covered: March 3rd through March 9th.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 17.0 hrs

•	Reviewed with Chemistry Group and made a list of requested changes, wrote up and circulated meeting notes.
•	Changed abundance indicator to match requested changes (in collaboration with Sam Reid).
•	Fixed issues in the periodic table - changed Lu to La and Lr to Ac.  This will affect Build an Atom.
•	Made indicators on the 1st tab be closed at startup.
•	Added the mass number to the element label on the first tab.
•	Made legend on first tab smaller and made its background color match the canvas.
•	Made the "Other X Isotopes" caption invisible when element is entirely made up of a single isotope.
•	Made legend on first tab smaller and made its background color match the canvas.
•	Changed all occurrences of "sulphur" to "sulfur".
•	Replaced all usages of the newly deprecated ModelViewController2D class with ModelViewController.
•	Restructured main model class to support addition and removal of isotopes directly to the test chamber (instead of via buckets).
•	Added initial cut of slider controls to the canvas.

Build a Molecule - 5.0 hrs

•	Read through the specification and added comments to the spec.
•	Discussed the BAM spec with Sam R and Jonathan O.
•	Researched other molecule editor applications that already exist, added notes to the specification.
•	Met with Emily M to discuss Piccolo2D, 3D possibilities, tradeoffs and constraints that exist based on our current development approach.
•	Met with Emily M, Jonathan O, and Sam R to review and modify the specification.

Gene Machine: Protein Synthesis - 3.0

•	Reviewed pencast of meeting with Kathy P and Mike K.
•	Researched terms and concepts described during meeting.
•	Made changes to sketches and specification based on meeting, sent modified version to Kathy P for review and feedback.

Molecules and Light - 1.5

•	Worked on color blindness issue (see #2769), found an alternative color blindness simulation tool for comparison.

Membrane Channels - 1.0 hrs

•	Added main topics and key words to the simulation page, made it visible on the production server.

Installers - 4.0

•	Rebuilt with changes for sponsors, worked with Jonathan O. to integrate his changes.
•	Tested and redeployed to web site.
•	Resolved an issue with the Build and Atom sim where an incorrect version was being ripped (and run) from the web site.
•	Tested fairly thoroughly, since Kathy P wants to distribute the installer at the conferences that she is attending this week.

KSU Credits - 1.0

•	Tested several flash simulations for correct behavior, see #2725.

Environment - 1.5

•	Get the Big Mac 10.6 configuration working for outgoing web access (had to set permanent DNS server addresses).
•	Checked the Unfuddle Notifier, found two processes running, killed both and restarted.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

•	Taking a week of vacation March 21st through 25th.

What’s Next

•	Continue design of Protein Synthesis simulation.
•	Continue design of Build a Molecule simulation.
•	Finish implementing Isotopes sim, publish versions for review and possibly for interviews.
•	Follow up on Chris M's review of Molecules & Light code.

Gene Machine: Protein Synthesis - 5.25

•	Finished first round of sketches for 2nd tab.
•	Met with a group from the biology department to discuss their needs.
•	Created the specification document in Google docs, added initial outline and started fleshing it out.
•	Updated sketches based on initial meeting with Kathy.
•	Investigated some of the on-line resources pointed out by the biology group.
•	Met with Mike Klymkowsky to discuss more about cell biology simulations.

Greenhouse - 1.0 hrs

•	Regression tested, since the Molecules and Light sim had been pulled out and several bugs have been fixed.
•	Published a version for review by Kathy P and Oliver N.

Build an Atom - 1.0 hrs

•	Regression tested in order to make sure there were no ill effects resulting from changes to common game code, see #2727.

Molecules and Light - 0.25 hrs

•	Put a PDF snapshot of the design doc into SVN.

Sim Sharing - 0.5 hrs

Time period covered: June 23rd through June 28nd.  Note that this is 6 days instead of the usual 7, in order to get in sync with the new weekly meeting schedule.

Isotopes - 3.0 hrs

•	Changed caption for making the isotope box white to "White Isotope Box"
•	Cleaned up the last of the code review notes, updated the related Unfuddle tickets.
•	Looked at issue of tiny slider knobs.

Gene Expression Basics - 9.25 hrs

•	Experimented with various approaches for allowing navigation along the DNA strand, settled on one that uses built-in Piccolo support (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Created the DNA strand, including the wrapping, layering for faux 3D effect, and the base pairs.
•	Met with Mike K (twice) to discuss sim design.  See meeting notes in Gene Expression specification for details.
•	Modified specification based on input from Mike K.
•	Published a dev version.

Balance and Torque - 7.0 hrs

•	Added the weight box, from which users can drag weights (currently just bricks) on to the balance.
•	Added the ability to have the weights come and go from the model (in collaboration with Sam R).

Sugar and Salt Solutions - 0.75 hrs

•	Worked on adding a combo box for selecting solute on the 2nd tab (in collaboration with Sam R).

Atomic Interactions - 1.5 hrs

•	Met with Noah P to discuss the modeling assumptions section of the teacher tips for this sim, wrote up the section and sent to Trish L for review.

Common Code - 3.5 hrs

•	Modified the LinearValueControl class so that the knobs would look larger on Windows 7, see #2979.
•	Tested a number of simulations that could have been affected by the fixes made for the small slider knob issue, see #2979.

Installers - 1.0

What’s Next

•	Continue working on Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue working on Balance & Torque simulation.
•	Finish testing installer with activities.  Oliver has consented to help with this.

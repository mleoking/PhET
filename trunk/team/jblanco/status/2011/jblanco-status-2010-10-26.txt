PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
October 26th, 2011

Time period covered: October 20th through October 26th.

Balance and Torque - 22 hrs

•	Worked out the mass values and added enough new masses that the user should be able to get through the game at least one full time with no duplicated challenges.
•	Modified the "moderate" balance challenge to use other masses in addition to bricks.
•	Checked and adjusted scaling factors for all masses so that images would look reasonable.
•	Added key handling for the game tab so that users can move through the challenges more quickly if desired.
•	Fixed an issue with center of gravity being off for some masses used in the game.
•	Added a constraint to the multi-mass challenges that masses be at least 2 ticks apart.  This prevents obscuring of labels.
•	Cleaned up and reorganized code in preparation for release and code review.
•	Performed color blindness testing.
•	Worked with Sam to test on Mac.
•	Brainstormed with Ariel P on the design of the High School version.

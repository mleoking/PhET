PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
August 31st, 2011

Time period covered: August 23rd through August 31st.  This includes 7 work days instead of the usual 5 due to a change in the meeting schedule.

Gene Expression Basics - 29.0 hrs

•	Implemented the 1D random walk for biomolecules attached to the DNA at non-specific sites.
•	Added motion bounds for mobile biomolecules.
•	Designed and implemented a state machine for making most aspects of biomolecule behavior common.
•	Added the ability for the DNA to have attachment sites with specific affinities for certain molecules.
•	Implemented the motion for RNA polymerase to do transcription.
•	Added the ability to biomolecules to locate high-affinity attachment sites on the DNA molecule.
•	Added the ability to biomolecules to change shape (a.k.a. conformation) when attached to an attachment site.
•	Added the capability to synthesize mRNA to RNA polymerase.
•	Added utilities to help create a "curvy" shape, used by messenger RNA.
•	Changed the placement hints to be associated with genes instead of the DNA itself, got them working for all three genes.


Balance and Torque - 10.0 hrs

•	Made the plank grabbable so that the user can tilt it.
•	Made the mystery objects wider, since the spacing of the tick marks on the plank has changed.
•	Discussed design of upcoming versions with Ariel P.
•	Fixed issue where force vectors didn't move when plank was tilted.
•	Removed 2nd tab, which was stubbed.  This is so we can send out for feedback.
•	Published version for review.
•	Responded to comments received in emails based on review by Christine (teacher in Texas).


Sugar and Salt Solutions - 1.5 hrs

•	Collaborated with Sam R on improving the behavior of 3-element crystals.

Density - 1.0 hr

•	Collaborated with Sam R on adding changes for a custom version to be used in a study.

Common Code - 0.5 hrs

•	Created ticket for adding ability to remove upper and lower tick marks to the common ruler code.

Customer Support - 1.0 hrs

•	Answered some questions about JNLP files and getting updates for Pearson, discussed with Kathy P.

Miscellaneous - 1.0 hrs

•	Provided my Adobe Illustrator sim design templates to Ariel P and discussed using Illustrator during the design phase of a simulation.


Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 9.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Weekly status report.
•	Entered July hours in tracking spreadsheet.
•	Reviewed, prioritized, and updated Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 3.0 hrs

•	1 hour vacation time on Thursday, August 25th
•	2 hours vacation time on Friday, August 26th
•	Out this Friday, September 2nd.

What’s Next

•	Continue developing Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue developing Balance & Torque simulation.
•	Continue developing States of Matter: Basics.
•	Tackle a couple of installer issues.

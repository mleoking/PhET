May 4th, 2011

Time period covered: April 28th through May 4th

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 10.0 hrs

•	Ran color blind checker, found several locations where pure red was being used that could be problematic, so they have been replaced.
•	Tested on Mac.
•	Changed the cells in the periodic table from being images to being drawn gradients in order to fix issues with the appearance on Macs.
•	Made particles (neutrons on first tab, atoms on 2nd) always be on top of everything on the canvas.
•	Reviewed with Chemistry Group
•	Fixed an issue with the periodic tables when the selection buttons were clicked multiple times.
•	Animated atoms on 2nd tab.
•	Fixed an issue with the stacking algorithm that occurred on both tabs.
•	Internal cleanup and consolidation of the code that represents buckets in the view.
•	Internal cleanup and consolidation of the code for the periodic tables.
•	Profiled and tested for memory leaks.

Gene Machine II: Protein Synthesis - 8.5 hrs

•	Created sketches for design of a tab that depicts DNA to mRNA transcription and mRNA to protein translation.
•	Continued background research.
•	Went through several text books for information about how this topic is currently taught.

Common Code - 3.5 hrs 

•	Investigated issue with sliders on Mac on Quantum Wave Interference and other sims, fixed it (in collaboration with Sam R) in common code, see #1619.
•	Worked with Chris on making the ButtonNode interface more like JButton and also making it work in some unusual situations that exist in the current code base.

Installer - 2.0

•	Discussed adding activities to installer with Kathy P and Jonathan O, see #182.
•	Researched number of requests for CD-ROM version with Oliver N in order to determine whether it is worth the effort to create an installer with activities, see #182.
•	Checked for updated version of Java 1.5, logged issue about upgrading to 1.6 for bundling with the installer.

ADA Compliance - 1.0 hrs

•	Showed Oliver how to perform color blindness testing.

Professional Development - 1.5 hrs

•	Went to DEPR talk presented by Kelly Lancaster.

Interviews - 3.0

•	Attended presentation by potential post doc.
•	Interviewed potential post doc and then met with other developers to discuss.

Grant Investigation - 1.5

Contacts - 1.0 hr

•	Review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0.0 hrs

•	Will be out Monday, May 9th.

What’s Next

•	Work on design of Protein Synthesis sim, begin implementation.

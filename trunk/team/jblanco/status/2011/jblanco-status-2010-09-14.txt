Time period covered: September 8th through September 14th.

Balance and Torque - 24.0 hrs

•	Made force vectors into "mystery vectors", i.e. question marks in same colors as other vectors.
•	Improved the look of the outline text, cleaned up for possible addition to common code.
•	Improved artwork to get rid of "peg leg" look for one of the characters.
•	Published a version with the first tab nearly complete for review.
•	Designed and planned the implementation of the game.
•	Implemented basic state machine for the game.
•	Implemented all view elements for the basic game.
•	Simplified the relationship between the model and the view for the game (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Added the ability to portray the initial challenge with the plank tilted and supported by a column (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Implemented the Balance Challenge class that defines each of the balance problems presented to the user.
•	Implemented a class for generating randomized challenge sets.
•	Added level indicators (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Reviewed with Ariel P.
•	Added ruler to the game.
•	Incorporated mystery mass values supplied by Trish L into the first tab.
•	Published several versions that include the game for review and feedback.
•	Fixed various bugs found during reviews of published versions.
•	Started adding additional objects to be used as weights.

Gene Expression Basics - 3.0 hrs

•	Published a version for review.
•	Discussed some very preliminary interviews done by Emily M and Julia C using this sim.
•	Met with Mike Klymkowsky to review current state of simulation.
•	Wrote up notes from meeting with MK and added to spec.

Common Code - 2.0 hrs

•	Participated in discussion (via Unfuddle ticket #3067) about the way of storing and referencing time in the common game library.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 9.0 hrs

•	Weekly status meeting.
•	Weekly Physics team meeting.
•	Weekly status report.
•	August vacation and sick leave form.

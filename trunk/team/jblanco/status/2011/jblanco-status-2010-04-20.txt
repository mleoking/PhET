PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
April 20th, 2011

Time period covered: April 14th through April 20th.

Isotopes and Atomic Mass – 17.5 hrs

•	Reviewed comments from Jack B and Loretta J with the Chemistry Group, listed changes, wrote up and circulated notes from meeting.
•	Removed overrides from the test chamber (internal refactoring and cleanup).
•	Made the atom size change based on the selected element.
•	Changed tab titles to "Make Isotopes" and "Mix Isotopes"
•	Changed caption on abundance indicator in first tab from "Natural Abundance" to "Abundance in Nature".
•	On 2nd tab, moved everything down a bit for more even spacing around the test chamber.
•	Made the atom size change based on the selected element.
•	Briefly reviewed a version with Kelly L prior to an interview.
•	Removed symbols from all translations, since they are not being used and we have decided not to support translated chemical symbols.
•	Performed a "dead code" analysis and removed quite a bit of code that was identified as unused.
•	Cleaned up TODOs and warnings.
•	Fixed an issue where the "My Isotope" label could overlap with the particle legend.
•	Fixed an issue with the positioning of the abundance indicator on the first tab.
•	Published two version for review.  The latest can be seen here: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/build-an-atom/2.03.02/

Gene Machine II: Protein Synthesis - 0.5 hrs

•	Put notes from meeting with people in the biology department into the spec.

Build a Molecule - 3.0 hrs

•	Collaborated with Jonathan O on the implementation of the collection chambers.
•	Reviewed a version with Emily M and discussed some changes to the specification.

Molecules and Light – 4.0

•	Implemented suggestions made in code review.
•	Regression tested Molecules and Light as well as Greenhouse (due to dependencies on shared code that was also reviewed).

Build an Atom - 1.0

•	Regression tested and redeployed with a fix for an issue with removing electrons from the electron cloud.

Density and Buoyancy - 3.5 hrs

•	Reviewed code (in collaboration with Chris M).

Bending Light - 0.5

•	Tested on slower Windows XP computers and reported results.
•	Created a ticket for the code review.

Environment - 3.0

•	Added Jack Barbara to the credits for Atomic Interactions, Build an Atom, and pH Scale.  He was added to both the web credits and the sim (i.e. Help) credits.
•	Discussed code review process with Kathy.
•	Updated code on the Big Mac due to a security warning issued by the university.  Only did version 1.6 of the OS.
•	Helped get Oliver set up to do deployments to dev.

Contacts - 1.0

•	Sent emails to several contacts who may have some connection into private foundations that could provide funding for PhET.
•	Forwarded information to Kathy D about a grant that was brought to my attention by people at Time Warner Cable.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 6.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET status meeting.
•	Weekly status report.
•	Vacation and sick leave reporting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0.0 hrs

•	Will be out Monday, May 9th.

What’s Next

•	Continue working on implementation of the Build a Molecule sim.
•	Code review of Bending Light simulation.
•	Work on design of Protein Synthesis sim, begin implementation.

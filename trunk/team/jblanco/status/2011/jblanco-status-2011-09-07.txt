PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
September 7th, 2011

Time period covered: September 1st through September 7th.

Balance and Torque - 15.0 hrs

•	Met with design team, wrote up and circulated meeting notes.
•	Fixed bug: Plank would keep moving if supports added back while plank was in motion.
•	Fixed bug: Very small imbalances would not produce any motion.
•	Added tick mark highlighting when objects are dropped on to the plank.
•	Made the mass labels appear over the center of gravity of the masses rather than their optical center.
•	Created artwork for and added a kit with females.
•	Created artwork for and added a 2nd set of mystery objects.
•	Fixed bug: Clicking on an item in the tool box and then immediately releasing it could cause a model object to be added and never removed.
•	Discussed educational benchmarks that might apply to levers tap with Ariel P.
•	Fixed some issues with the way that mystery objects are added from the tool box.
•	Improved layout of kits containing mystery objects.

Gene Expression Basics - 3.0 hrs

•	Finished adding support for motion bounds for the mobile biomolecules, including handling of the toolboxes.

Common Code - 1.5 hrs

•	Made the ability to turn off the ticks on portions of the ruler common (in collaboration with Sam R), see #3052.
•	Reviewed changes made to CursorHandler in order to allow the cursor to rotate (or otherwise change) when moving something, see #3061.

Customer Support - 1.0 hrs

•	Talked with Kathy P and JO (separately) about how to support Pearson in keeping our simulations up to date.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 3.5 hrs

•	Weekly status report.
•	Certified my ePER.
•	Reviewed, prioritized, and updated Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 16.0 hrs

•	Took September 2nd as a vacation day.
•	Monday, September 5th, was a holiday (Labor Day).

What’s Next

•	Continue developing Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue developing Balance & Torque simulation.
•	Continue developing States of Matter: Basics.

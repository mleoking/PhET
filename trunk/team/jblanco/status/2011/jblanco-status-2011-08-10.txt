PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
August 9th, 2011

Time period covered: August 3rd through August 9th.

Balance and Torque - 17.0 hrs

•	Added more friction and some thresholding so that balance will stabilize more quickly.
•	Simplified model for torque on plank based on review by Mike D.
•	Implemented the distance vectors.
•	Moved supports to avoid overlap of red x and force vectors.
•	Made it easier to place objects on the plank by having the decision point be their centers rather than the bottom.
•	Improved overall layout of control panels.
•	Published a version for review.
•	Responded to Emily M's email with feedback from one of the teachers with whom she is working.
•	Integrated scrolling tool box for the masses (in collaboration with Sam R).
•	Implemented placement algorithm that prevents masses from being placed at the same location on the plank.
•	Fixed issues with center for mass for asymmetrical masses (which are basically the people).
•	Fixed issues with layout of masses box.
•	Made the objects grabbed off of the plank be better positioned under the user's mouse.
•	Met with design team and separately with Ariel P.
•	Wrote up and circulated notes from design team meeting.

Gene Expression Basics - 12.5 hrs

•	Created a utility function for producing smoothed shapes from a set of points.
•	Improved layout of tool box.
•	Modified genes to have explicitly specified regulatory and transcribed regions.
•	Moved first gene to (0,0) so that initial scrolling doesn't occur.
•	Made DNA longer so that ends are not seen under the vast majority of circumstances.
•	Improved the shape of the ribosome.
•	Added gradients to biomolecules for a better look.
•	Added Reset All functionality.

States of Matter Basics - 1.0 hrs

•	Reviewed design doc, sent questions to Emily M.

Common Code - 3.0 hrs

•	Verified #3031 - Implementation of retainall for ObservableList.
•	Changed Vector2DNode to use ImmutableVector where appropriate.
•	Worked with Sam R to make the scrollable kits into common code.

Environment - 2.0 hrs

•	Still not getting a response from JR about putting 10.7 on the PhEt Test Mac.  I'll stop by his office this week.
•	Got IntelliJ working on the PhET Test Mac (in collaboration with Sam R).

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 4.5 hrs

•	Weekly status report.
•	July vacation and sick leave form.
•	Dealt with some weird problem with Google Docs and my CU account.
•	Reviewed, prioritized, and updated Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 0 hrs

What’s Next

•	Continue developing Gene Expression simulation.
•	Continue developing Balance & Torque simulation.
•	Continue developing States of Matter: Basics.

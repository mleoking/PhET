PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
January 27, 2010

Neuron Sim - 10.5 hrs

•	Worked on incorporation of an implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model for action potentials that was found on line.  Hopefully, this will save implementation time.  Model has been partially incorporated, but isn't quite working yet.
•	Revised the membrane potential chart to be a strip chart so that the data doesn't run off the end.
•	Discussed and reviewed model implementation and the development plan with Noah P.

Lac Operon Sim - 7.0 hrs

•	Made the tool box items appear when clicked instead of when dragged.  This should make it easier to avoid confusion about what to do with the items in the tool box.
•	Turned the "Reset" button into "Reset All" and made the behavior more consistent with other PhET sims.
•	Fixed an issue where the spaces for elements on the DNA would disappear on the reset (found during testing by Jared T).
•	Fixed an issue where the button on the injector would work even when invisible.
•	Improved the way in which users grab objects in the play area.
•	Published the updated version.  This is the version that Noah P has started using for interviews.
•	Discussed results of first student interview with Noah P.

Energy Skate Park - 3.0 hrs

•	Worked with Sam to reinstate the "Tracks" menu item.
•	Removed the "Bounciness" and "Stickiness" controls.
•	Posted new version to dev for testing.

Nuclear Physics - 0.5 hrs

•	Published updated version to the production server with fixes for two recently found bugs.  Notified bug reporters of fixes.

PhET Installers - 8.0 hrs

•	Added parameters to remove bandwidth limitations from httrack during the rip so that it won't take so long.  Tested this, and the build that previously took 30 hrs now takes about 1.5 hrs.
•	Verified changes that enable the Flash sims to report that they are being launched from another web site.
•	Rebuilt, tested, and posted a new version of the KSU installer.  Sent email to Hisham letting him know that it is available.
•	Rebuild the YF installer to incorporate the Flash fix.
•	Discussed with Wendy whether YF really needed translated JAR files, ultimately recognized that they don't, so a new (substantially smaller) version was created and sent to them that omits these files.

Piccolo 1.3 - 4.0 hrs

•	Downloaded the Piccolo 1.3 release candidate (rc1) and placed into SVN.
•	Tested a number of sims using this new version and found no problems.
•	Worked with Chris to duplicate several problems that he found on his sims.

Unfuddle Issues - 1.0 hrs

•	Worked with Chris to verify some issues that he had fixed on the Greenhouse sim.
•	Tested and verified an issue related to transparency of GradientButtonNode.
•	Sent information to a customer who is experiencing problems using Java sims on limited accounts at a school (Unfuddle #2119).

Development Environment - 1.0

•	Investigated setting up a 10.6 partition on the Big Mac so we can test on this version of the Mac OS as well as versions 10.4 and 10.5.  Got the disk and the information necessary to do it.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

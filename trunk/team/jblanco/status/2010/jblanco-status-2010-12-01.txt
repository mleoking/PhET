John Blanco
December 1, 2010

Note: This status report covers a two week period, since last week was a holiday (Thanksgiving).

Build an Atom - 15.0 hrs

•	Added new game level.
•	Added new problem types that ask the user a verbal question about the atom's configuration.
•	Changed animation for unstable nuclei to be on by default.
•	Met with Chemistry Team to discuss new game level.
•	Removed problems with symbol on left side from level 3 of the game.
•	Made the "Check" button always enabled on problems where "0" is a valid answer.
•	Added a constraint where the same problem type is never presented twice in a row.
•	Fixed issue where charge and mass were incorrectly displayed if the indicator boxes were expanded before interacting with the atom.
•	Fixed issue where removal of outer electrons was not causing proper updates of indicators.
•	Internationalized several problem types that needed it.
•	Published a version for review and solicited feedback.

Molecules and Light - 11.5 hrs

•	Added the new atoms to the control panel.
•	Created the new molecule selection panel that shows both the name and chemical symbol.
•	Internationalized molecule names.
•	Enlarged the drawing of the UV emitter so the image would not appear blurry.
•	Made the delocalized bonds be random, i.e. either right or left, upon construction.
•	Added the feature where a connecting line is shown between the selected range in the spectrum and the selector button.
•	Modified the colors of the photon emission controller for a more engaging look.

Isotope - 7.0 hrs

•	Created 1st drawing of the 2nd tab.
•	Met with Chemistry Team to brainstorm look and behavior of 2nd tab.
•	Working meeting with Kelly L. to modify 2nd tab drawing.
•	Added buckets, scale, mass indicator, and pie chart to 2nd tab drawing.
•	Added drawings to the spec.

Common Code - 5.0 hrs

•	Worked (partially in collaboration with Chris M) on SpectrumImageFactory - Made it work for linear or exponential x axes.
•	Worked with Chris M on ButtonNode - Improved the look of the Disabled mode.

Installer - 4.0 hrs

•	Added the blog to the local mirrors (in collaboration with JO).
•	Tested inclusion of the blog.
•	Put latest installers on to USB drives for an upcoming conference.
•	Disabled and then re-enabled the automated build so that it wouldn't run over Thanksgiving (since no one would be available to test it).

Environment - 2.5 hrs

•	Removed blackboards and mounted white boards in my and Kathy's offices (most of this was done on my own time).

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 11.0 hrs

•	Two weekly PhET team meetings.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 24.0 hrs

•	One vacation day - Wednesday November 24th.
•	Two holidays, Thanksgiving and the day after.

What’s Next

•	Support interviews on Build an Atom.
•	Implement spins and disassociations of molecules in Molecules and Light.
•	Continue the draw-review cycle on Isotope.
•	Implement any changes resulting from interviews on Membrane Channels (if conducted).

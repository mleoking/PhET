Build an Atom - 16.0 hrs (much of this word done in collaboration with Sam R) 

•	Changed animation to be overall jitter instead of individual nucleon motion.
•	Decoupled animation and the "Show Stable/Unstable" behavior.
•	Made the "Cloud View" scale the cloud based on number of electrons, and not have any shell structure.
•	Added a new game problem where only one of the portions of the symbol need to be filled in (instead of all three) and there are specific prompts for the value that is being entered.
•	Fixed issue where "Stable" label would appear on empty nucleus.
•	Changed to show Stable/Unstable by default.
•	Fixed an issue where the animation was incorrect for showing the answer when a schematic atom was the right-side representation.
•	Fixed some issues with the atom configurations.
•	Published versions for review and for interviews.

Molecules and Light - 12.0 hrs

•	Created art work for microwave and UV photon emitters.
•	Created art work for the UV and microwave photons.
•	Created initial control panel.
•	Added the ability to emit UV and microwave photons to the model.
•	Added spectrum depiction to the photon emission control panel.

Sim Sharing feature - 1.5 hrs

•	Reviewed related portion of NSF grant.
•	Attended meeting to discuss requirements of feature.

Acid & Base Solutions - 0.5 hrs

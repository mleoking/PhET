John Blanco
August 16, 2010

Note: Due to vacation, this report covers a 3-week period rather than the usual single week.

Greenhouse - 14.5 hrs

•	Made the photons shoot in multiple directions when "Build Atmosphere" selected.
•	Increased emission rate when "Build Atmosphere" selected.
•	Added icons to photon emitter.
•	Fixed an issue where photons sometimes move too fast when reemitted.
•	Changed atmosphere to have no molecules at startup.
•	Removed N2O from single molecules, added CH4 to atmospheric molecules.
•	Added slider to emission control for controlling emission rate.
•	Improved algorithm for distributing molecules in the atmosphere.
•	Got Reset All working correctly.
•	Investigated Java heap space issue.
•	Published version for review and for use during meeting with Chem Board.
•	Implemented tool tips for the various molecule selections that display their common names (e.g. Methane).

Membrane Diffusion - 15.0 hrs

•	Implemented simple crossing of particles through the membrane.
•	Made it possible to show the capture zones (for debug and test purposes).
•	Increased the frame rate for better animation.
•	Added hysteresis to channel-crossing algorithm to prevent instant recapture.
•	Implemented selector to allow for injection of either particle type into the upper and lower chambers.
•	Removed the chemical symbol names from the concentration graphs.


Nuclear Physics - 3.0 hrs

•	Added a workaround for the issue where multi-line caption is shown incorrectly for RTL languages.
•	Reported word wrap bug to Sun/Oracle.
•	Replaced some of the sound files with versions that Chris M. had reduced in size.
•	Replaced the class that was being used for sound generation with a common class that was created for this purpose by Chris M.
•	Published a version for review.

Neuron - 4.0 hrs

•	Discussed issues (via email) arising from first interviews with students.
•	Modified the Membrane Potential Chart to always show cursor and to allow users to grab it and drag backwards in order to move backwards in time.
•	Published two versions with slightly different behavior of the cursor control for rewind.  This was for review and comparison.

Inside Magnets - 2.5 hrs

•	Set up space in SVN for this new sim.
•	Worked with Gary Wysin to get a basic understanding of what his code does.
•	Added the model code supplied by Gary Wysin (visiting fellow from KSU) to SVN.
•	Obtained and also added license permission from Gary Wysin.

Customer Support - 0.5 hrs

•	Discussed via email with Kelly Reed (of Pearson) some questions concerning Flash JAR files.

Installer Builders 0.5

•	Updated the Unfuddle notebook with information about where the backups are kept, fixed some other inaccuracies.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 8.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting
•	Brought my son Graham in to be interviewed for the activities being developed for middle school students.
•	Changed identiky password
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Holiday, and Sick Leave - 72.0 hrs

•	Took vacation from July 29 through August 10
•	Will be taking 1 or 2 days around Labor day.

What’s Next

•	Finish Membrane Diffusion
•	Make any other changes that resulf from interviews on Neuron.
•	Start on next sim.

Neuron Sim - 25.5 hrs

•	Hooked the openness of the sodium and potassium gates to conductance instead of current in Hodgkin-Huxley model.
•	Improved the appearance of the traveling action potential on the axon membrane by combining two shapes.
•	Implemented a "lockout" for the stimulate button.
•	Moved Stimulate button to the play area.
•	Got particles to move through channels and fade in a way that is visually appealing.
•	Made the particles that started towards channel traversal but didn't make it fade out.
•	Changed time scale so that it is easier to see flow in and out at default speed.
•	Changed chart scale to make the action potentials stand out more.
•	Changed line drawn on potential chart to be more visible.
•	Took the "Reset All" button off of the control panel, since it doesn't really make sense any more.
•	Set up layering on the canvas so that the particles appear to move through the channels instead of over them.
•	Changed the color of the leak channels so that they are distinct from the gated channels.
•	Put a gradient on the axon body to make it look more 3D.
•	Removed 2nd tab, since it is no longer part of the design.
•	Reviewed progress with Noah P, discussed next steps.
•	Removed voltmeter for now, since it is not complete and we may not keep it long term, so it would be distracting if reviewed by others.
•	Implemented initial cut of leak of ions through the leak channels.
•	Created a different mix of leak and gated channels to look more “natural”.
•	Worked on optimizations for drawing of the membrane potential chart, since current implementation bogs down the CPU when chart scrolls.
•	Added back the zoom control.
•	Published a version for review.

Lac Operon - 4.0 hrs

•	Reviewed with Noah P, brainstormed ways to address some recently raised issues with interactions between RNA polymerase and LacI.
•	Implemented changes to prevent race conditions between LacI and RNA polymerase.
•	Implemented changes to prevent LacZ from being produced when no lactose is present.
•	Published version for review.

Circuit Construction Kit - 3.5 hrs

•	Worked with Sam to try to solve issues surrounding capacitors in circuits with little or no resistance.  For now, we added a warning message for this situation, since we didn't come up with any obvious solution.  See Unfuddle tickets #2138 and #2087 for more detail.
•	Published CCK with warning message to dev for review, updated bug reports.
 
Development Environment - 2.0 hrs

•	Downloaded Piccolo 1.3 rc3 and put it into SVN.
•	Tested several sims with Piccolo 1.3 rc3, all looked good.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Vacation, Sick Leave, and Holidays

•	Planning to take Friday, February 26th as a vacation day.

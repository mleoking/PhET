PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
April 14, 2010

Neuron Sim - 18.5 hrs

•	Reviewed specification for 1st tab with Noah P.
•	Added drawing of proposed action potential tab to the spec.  Current thinking is that we probably won't add this, at least not at this time, but may do so in the future.
•	Implemented the bulk of the first tab (Membrane Diffusion), including:
•	Underlying model.
•	Particle injection.
•	Canvas showing particle chamber, membrane, and tool box.
•	The tool box.
•	There is a review scheduled for the coming Monday with the IPHY people.

Lac Operon - 8.0 hrs

•	Fixed bug - Lactose meter would overflow on 2nd tab when there was little lactose in the cell and lots outside of it.
•	Made the amount of LacY produced more consistent, increased the rate at which it moves lactose, and adjusted its lifetime in order to get it to move the lactose into the cell more quickly.
•	Adjusted some of the other simulation parameters so that the lactose level would remain more constant when in homeostasis.
•	Meeting with Noah P on Thursday for some final adjustments before setting up review with UBC folks.

Development Environment - 2.0

•	Tested an old hard drive for whether it would work for backups, found it dysfunctional, ordered a new drive to use for backups.

Miscellaneous - 0.5

•	Read through email about a request for assistance from the Concordia Consortium, discussed with Chris.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 5.0 hrs

•	Weekly PhET meeting.
•	Normal review and updating of Unfuddle issues.
•	Normal email and administrative overhead.

Holidays, Vacation, and Sick Leave - 6.0 hrs

•	Took most of Monday, April 12, as a sick day.

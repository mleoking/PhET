PhET Weekly Progress Report
John Blanco
March 1st, 2012

Time period covered: February 16th through February 29th (two week period due to canceled status meeting).

Gene Expression - 36.5 hrs

-	Refactored to support multiple transcription factors, added to 2nd and 3rd genes.
-	Changes transcription factor positions so that pos and neg are not in same place but overlap in order to block each other.
-	Prevented polymerase from attaching to DNA in such a way that it overlaps the transcription factor.
-	Added "fade-out label" for mRNA.
-	Reviewed notes from interviews (thanks to JC and EM for these).  Most items have been addressed, but a few still need discussion.
-	Changed motion strategies to that molecules that don't bind to the DNA don't wander over it (this created some confusion in interviews).
-	Implemented initial model for 2nd tab (mRNA production).
-	Implemented user interface for 2nd tab.
-	Worked out and implemented motion bounds for 2nd tab.
-	Implemented reset for 2nd tab.

Tablet Investigation - 10 hrs

-	Improved the HTML5 sim "Simple Build and Atom" to the point where we would be comfortable sharing it with the CK
    o Made the buckets have the faux 3D look.
    o Labeled buckets.
    o Made particles permanent and stack in bucket reasonably well.
    o Improved reset behavior, as well as the look of the button.

Balancing Act - 2.0 hrs

-	Sent log of sim sharing messages from game that include points scored to Min Chi to see if it meets her needs.  No response as of yet.
-	Sent some of the Scala code that interprets sim sharing data to Min Chi for evaluation.

Sim Sharing and Data Collection - 4.0 hrs

-	Created a load test that uses more of the sim sharing infrastructure.  All tests run so far have succeeded.
-	Changed initial ID dialog to have boarder.

Energy Forms and Changes - 2.0 hrs

-	Read through spec, did some edits, asked questions.

Math Sims - 1.5 hrs

-	Discussed planned simulations with Ariel P.

Fractions - 3.0 hrs

-	Collaborated with Sam R on game tab.
-	Discussed design of 1st tab with Ariel P.

States of Matter - 1.0 hr

-	Discussed some issues that she saw during classroom use.  Ariel P also was involved.

Nuclear Fission - 1.0 hr

-	Investigated issue raised by user about decay of U-239.

Math Sims - 1.0 hr

-	Met with Ariel to discuss work on upcoming math simulations.

Common Code - 1.5 hrs

-	Verification of fixes by other developers (#3258,

Environment - 1.0 hrs

-	Worked with Doug J to make sure the server we planned to purchase would work in his environment.
-	New server is in the house (Oliver's office), will probably start setup on Monday.

Outreach and Fund Raising - 1.5 hrs

-	Participated in conference call to discuss the use of PhET sims by the CK-12 Foundation.

Professional Development - 1.0 hr

-	Colloquium on quantum computing.

Meetings, Email, and Other Administrative Overhead - 13.0 hrs

-	Weekly status meeting.
-	Weekly status report.
-	Review, prioritization, and updating of Unfuddle issues.
-	Normal email and administrative overhead.

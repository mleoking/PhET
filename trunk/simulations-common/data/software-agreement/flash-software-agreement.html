A complete list of third-party software used, the developers, and the associated licenses is available from within each simulation. In Java, from the Help -> About menu, choose the Credits button. In Flash, open the dialog using the About button, and then choose the credits button.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="12"><b>F. <u>ALTERNATIVE LICENSING OPTIONS</u></b></font><br><br>Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu">http://phet.colorado.edu</a>, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:phethelp@colorado.edu">phethelp@colorado.edu</a>.<br><br><font size="12"><b><u>II. PRIVACY POLICY</u></b></font><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="12"><b>A. <u>COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY</u></b></font><br><br>The University of Colorado and the PhET Project are committed to the protection of individual privacy, and ensuring the confidentiality of information provided by its employees, students, visitors, and resource users.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="12"><b>B. <u>INFORMATION COLLECTED</u></b></font><br><br>In order to document the amount of use of PhET simulations and to provide the best services to our users, PhET collects a minimal amount of non-personally identifying information upon each simulation start-up (e.g. sim version, operating system, java version, ...).<br><br>When the simulation is launched online from http://phet.colorado.edu, information is collected via standard website statistics services.<br><br>When the simulation is launched from another source (e.g. a downloaded simulation file), a small message is sent to PhET as the simulation starts up. You can disable sending this information (see USER PREFERENCES below).<br><br>A complete list of the information sent to PhET is available in the simulations. For Java simulations, go to Files->Preferences, select the Privacy tab, and click on the "information" link. For Flash simulations, go to the Preferences button and click on the "information" link in the Privacy section.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="12"><b>C. <u>INFORMATION SECURITY</u></b></font><br><br>The PhET Project has in place appropriate security measures to protect against the unauthorized use or access of its data. Such measures include internal review of data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where data is stored.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="12"><b>D. <u>INFORMATION SHARING</u></b></font><br><br>Access to information collected through the use of PhET simulations is limited to those employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. The PhET Project may report a summary of this information (in aggregate) to other organizations and individuals for grant reporting purposes, or in published articles to document PhET's wide-spread use. No personally-identifying information is collected nor distributed. The PhET Project requires third parties to whom it discloses information to protect the information in accordance with this policy and applicable law.  In addition, the PhET Project may disclose information to third parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="12"><b>E. <u>COLORADO OPEN RECORDS ACT</u></b></font><br><br>The University of Colorado and the PhET project are subject to the Colorado Open Records Act, C.R.S § 24-72-101 et seq. The Colorado Open Records Act requires that all records maintained by the University and the PhET Project be available for public inspection except as otherwise provided by law.  Non-personal identifying information collected by the PhET Project may be subject to public inspection and copying unless protected by state or federal law.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="12"><b>F. <u>SETTING USER PREFERENCES</u></b></font><br><br>For simulations launched online from http://phet.colorado.edu, no preferences options are available because the simulation sends no start-up message to PhET.<br><br>When launching PhET simulations from any other location (e.g. a downloaded offline version), users may choose to disable the feature which sends the information message to the PhET Project.<br><br>Instructions for Java simulations: From the File->Preferences menu, choose the Privacy tab and uncheck the box in front of "Allow sending of information to PhET."  Users will still be able to receive notices of updates, but in this case, no information is sent to the PhET Project. To disallow updates, uncheck 'Automatically check for updates' in the Updates tab.<br><br>Instructions for Flash simulations: Open the dialog using the Preferences button. Uncheck the box in front of "Allow sending of information to PhET" in the Privacy section.  Users will still be able to receive notices of updates, but in this case, no information is sent to the PhET Project.

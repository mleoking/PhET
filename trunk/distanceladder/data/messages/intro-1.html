    <h1>Lost In Space</h1>
    <p align="left">While piloting your personal space craft through the galaxy,
        your incompetent android assistant erroneously pressed the &ldquo;hyperspace
        jump&rdquo; button.
        You now find yourself in an unknown location, and need to navigate your
        way back to your home solar system before missing the next episode of <em>The
        Simpsons</em>.</p>
    <p align="left">Your ship is capable, through use of its new infinite improbability
        drive, of instantaneously moving to any point in the universe, so long
        as you know the distance to that point.</p>
    <p align="left">Your ship has two instruments that will help you measure
        interstellar distances. One uses the principle of parallax,
        which works for stars that aren&rsquo;t
        too far away. The other measures the brightness of stars that you can
        see. By using them to measure distances to various stars, you can navigate
        to them, and eventually find your way home. </p>

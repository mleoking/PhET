    <h1 align="center">The Cockpit</h1>
    <p align="left">This is the display you will see first.
    You can get to it at any time by clicking on the <b>Cockpit</b> tab near
    the top of the screen.
    <h2>Maneuvering</h2>
    <p>You can change the direction the ship is pointed by moving the <b>Turn</b> slider
    near the top of the control panel to the right of the cockpit.
    <p>The joystick moves the ship left and right, only.
    <p>Your ship has a hyperdrive that can make it jump forward a specified distance. Its controls
    are located on the panel to the right of the cockpit</p>
    <h2>Measuring Distances</h2>
    <p>Your ship has two instruments that will help you measure
        interstellar distances. Buttons for activating these instruments are on the cockpit's dashboard.
        Their controls and readouts are on the right.
        <ul>
        <li>The <b>Parallax Instrument</b> uses the principle of parallax,
        which works for stars that aren't too far away.
        <li>The <b>Photometer</b> measures the brightness of stars that you can
        see. This is most useful for measuring the distances to certain types of stars that
        are too far away to measure using parallax.
        </ul>
    <p>By using these instruments to measure distances to various stars, you can navigate
        to them, and eventually find your way home. </p>

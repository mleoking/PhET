- Fix tranform for hit detection in Joystick. Currently using JoystickTx, but that doesn't seem
to work.

- Fix clipping at sides of StarView

- Fix model so you don't have to call setStarField() to get the views to update.

- Handle situation where cockpit is at same location as a star. The isVisible test needs to handle this.

- Make fixed star distance much larger, and debug the problems with this.

- Prevent stars from being too close together

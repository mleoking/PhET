- fix star map so control panel stays the same width

- Make widths of dialogs more reasonable.

- Pull computation of brightness out of the control panel and starVeiwGraphic and put it in the photometer

- Fix model so you don't have to call setStarField() to get the views to update.

- Handle situation where cockpit is at same location as a star. The isVisible test needs to handle this.

- Make fixed star distance much larger, and debug the problems with this.

- Prevent stars from being too close together

- ElectronSource adds electrons to the model. CollimatedBeam does not. They should both work the same way.

- Many of the model elements that are being created in the contructors for modules should be made in the
constructors for the models. That would help the sequencing of how things are created.

- Combine ElectronSink and ElectronSource into Electrode

- BeamCurtainGraphic points downward by default, and has a hack for rotating it.

- The rotated beam doesn't look right. Try an angle of 170 deg. to see.

- ElectronSink doesn't need to be an ElectronSourceListener, or whatever it is.

Issues
------
- There seems to be a ceiling on the max rate of electrons that can be produced
- Make fanout an attribute of CollimatedBeam, and make photons fan out
- Problem with initial view of beam graphic is in the determination of beamDepth in BeamCurtainGraphic.update(). When
it's fixed, get rid of hack in PhotoelectricModule constructor

- CollimatedBeam is screwed up. The direction parameter conflicts with the bounds, width and height, vertical and
horizontal, etc.


- Calibrate the volts according to Sam's note


Charts
------
Need much better documentation.
    - better examples
    - explanation of how Chart class works
    - LinePlot.setBorderColor() is a very misleading name
    - If you try to plot data that is out of range, you get nothing at all
    - Sam has inner classes in the middle of the outer class' code. At least he did in DataSet.

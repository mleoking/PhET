- ElectronSource adds electrons to the model. CollimatedBeam does not. They should both work the same way.

- Many of the model elements that are being created in the contructors for modules should be made in the
constructors for the models. That would help the sequencing of how things are created.

- Combine ElectronSink and ElectronSource into Electrode

- BeamCurtainGraphic points downward by default, and has a hack for rotating it.

- The rotated beam doesn't look right. Try an angle of 170 deg. to see.

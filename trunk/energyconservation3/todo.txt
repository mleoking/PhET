Bug: Wiggle me appears when K.P moves the slider.

I found a bug with the wiggle me for the jet pack. 
When I go to space or set gravity to zero, if I don't use the arrows before I hit RESET, 
they don't work. For example, if you go to space and then hit Reset, the arrows work the far right slider.

Jet pack isn't visible after reset.

Energy Skate park

So the set up is that the man is oscillating back and forth in on the 
default track. You turn friction on and watch his velocity decline as 
his thermal energy increases. She wanted to see him come to rest at 
the bottom. The problem is that he never comes to rest as he should, 
something keeps putting in pangs of a little velocity (if you graph 
it) and he keeps jumping around just a little bit, and eventually he 
falls through the track and speeds away with lots of speed.

Can you look into this and see if you can fix the behavior?

I was trying to simulate gravity using a downward thrust on the skater, 
and it essentially works, but it appears that the thrust is not 
constant, perhaps, but increases a little if you hold down the down 
arrow?  I was thinking that the desired functionality would be that a 
constant push on the down arrow would provide a constant thrust, and 
therefore the skater, with no friction, would simply replicate the 
affect in a gravitational field.  This would be a great way to show that 
gravity can not be distinguished from an accelerating frame of 
reference.  But, in the current simulation, even without friction the 
motion is damped and KE goes to zero (over a long period of time).  Do I 
have the interpretation incorrect?  Or did you create the functionality 
as you did for another reason?

Secondly, if you use the space simulation, and change to gravity and back, sometimes (can't be sure how exactly) the thruster/jets don't show on the skater in space mode, though he does move as if they are firing.  Seems like the simulation of his jet pack is not quite getting reset.

Bug: When user drags track that skater is resting on, the skater doesn't move with it.

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.
__

In my brief play I found a bug ... in the attached screen shot the
skater doesn't fall off the track even though he gets completely off the edge.
__

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

Optional to overlay a position-grid on the real space (to correlate with graph).
    Like moving man, force1d or ramps, disabled by default.

Add clipping to energy vs position plot (so data doesn't fall outside the data area).
>>We decided against this for wave interference on the grounds that:
1. It is not confusing.
2. It actually shows data that would be otherwise hidden.
We haven't yet gathered interview results for this; we should revise the plan here after interviews.

Record, then playback, then record deletes the first record sequence.  This may be a good default, but it occurred unexpectedly in the bugfix:
>>Bugfix: Setting record, then live, then record resets to last record state.

One question I have is were we going to have a mystery planet where 
they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...

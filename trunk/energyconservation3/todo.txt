When the user clicks on a track  (for a right-click menu), it thinks the user is dragging the spline, so doesn't work to conserve energy.

Could try searching ahead a few steps to see if the skater will get stuck...

Does it really make sense to have a ground while in space? (not saved since location just needs to be space to see)

If left on and the yellow dots of the path record allowed to accumulate, it 
seems to cause tremendous lag in the program (maybe set a limit on how long it can be 
left on?)

Sometimes the skater gets stuck.  Difficult to reproduce.

Crashing skater?

add spanish

Add game-ish modes to sk8r application
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.
        Is this problem resolved?

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

One question I have is were we going to have a mystery planet where 
they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...

Jetpack is shown in an incorrect position when the character is on the track.

-If curvature of the track is too great (not gradual enough) the skater
cannot move passed
the vertex and will bounce off of it.
        This only happens if it's not 'rollercoaster mode' and if the skater flys away from the track.
        
- slow motion button doesn't seem to work right
        Clarifying...
        
-If the skater goes off screen and the user is holding down an arrow key
when they click "bring back the skater" or "return skater" the skater will return and
immediately start thrusting in that direction regardless of what arrow keys are or are not
being pushed.  The only way to fix this is to reset the entire simulation.
        We couldn't reproduce this.
        
After some combination of recording and playback, the track graphic becomes dissociated from the skater.
        The skater will continue to traverse the path where the track used to be, even after it has been dragged.
        This solution is a bit of a hack.

Save/Load not working sometimes
        Could be: throwing an exception, "body.debug angles inconsistent"
        This may be fixed now; I was unable to reproduce the problem so I can't claim this with much certainty.

-When coefficient of friction is turned to maximum and there is a lot of
gravity (maximum) the skater falls through the track at the bottom point and
bounces around the bottom of the screen before shooting off in a random direction 
(his exact reaction varies each time).
        This problem is partially reduced.  Friction + Gravity + Track Curvature increases probability of getting this problem.

Add a warning box to the reset button that says, Are you sure you want to reset everything?

Bug: The scale for the readings on the path data is still way huge ever since
you resized the world. When I right click on a data point, I can just barely
see the bottom of some very huge numbers.

Can the bar chart have a clear button also?  That's a really good way to
get rid of the out of control thermal energy.

Bug: Also on the bar chart, there's a little minimize box which gets rid of
the chart within it's window but the window stays up.  I can't find where it
went to.  I tried clicking on the bar graph button on the control panel and
it does nothing. If I close the bar graph with the red x and then ask for it
again from the control panel it comes back up blank still.

Bug: When I minimize my window for the entire simulation and bring it back
up, only the energy vs. position graph comes back with the sim and the other
two are gone.

6.  Is it possible to give the skater any velocity when he's in space?  I
thought there used to be a way but I can't figure it out.
>>We used to allow right click-drag to add velocity, but never added it in this new version since nobody knew about it.

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint, the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.
Can we put up a button on the screen when the skater has exited the screen: "Return Skater"?
Add a helmet.
Optional to overlay a position-grid on the real space (to correlate with graph).
    Like moving man, force1d or ramps, disabled by default.
Put coefficient of friction in an advanced button.
Zoomable Energy vs Position graphs.
Bug: Setting record, then live, then record resets to last record state.
Add clipping to energy vs position plot (so data doesn't fall outside the data area).

Bug: When user drags track that skater is resting on, the skater doesn't move with it.
[internal] Figure out the meaning of the magic grab number in EnergyConservationModel

Maybe "Live" should be changed to "Go" instead of "Play"
Bug: clear button erroneously shows 'this simulation is paused' when it is not.
 Bug: The measuring tape's initial readout is incorrect.

low priority:
User-selectable skater/vehicle graphics.
Crashing skater?

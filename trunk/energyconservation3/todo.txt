Energy is not conserved when I move the gravity slider.  
Sometimes when I move the slider to higher gravity he’ll gain energy and go off the end of a track that he was previously 
confined to when on earth.  Other times when I move the slider from earth to Jupiter to earth he will not 
get as high in the earth frame as he had been in the earth before changing gravity.  

Sometimes he bounces off the end of a track that he should just fly off of. 

When you move from space to earth the use arrow keys to thrust stays up.

The skater hung up on the top of the ramp easily if I was trying to retest my track.
        Clarifying...

Bugs: 
- slow motion button doesn't seem to work right
        Clarifying...
- when I pulled up energy vs time graph, and messed around with pausing, using cursor, and trying to go again ... it got confused. (Right now I can't get the guy to start moving again ... even when I hit Reset.) 
- in space, the thruster doesn't seem to work like gravity still 
- the energy vs time graph stopped plotting anything at one point and even though man was going I couldn't get it to plot. 

The skater gets stuck in a track sometimes (bounces back and forth, centered on the track)

Add friction for bounces, when friction is enabled.

Jetpack is shown in an incorrect position when the character is on the track.

Are history buttons displaying total energy without thermal, and calling it total?

I was trying to simulate gravity using a downward thrust on the skater, 
and it essentially works, but it appears that the thrust is not 
constant, perhaps, but increases a little if you hold down the down 
arrow?  I was thinking that the desired functionality would be that a 
constant push on the down arrow would provide a constant thrust, and 
therefore the skater, with no friction, would simply replicate the 
affect in a gravitational field.  This would be a great way to show that 
gravity can not be distinguished from an accelerating frame of 
reference.  But, in the current simulation, even without friction the 
motion is damped and KE goes to zero (over a long period of time).  Do I 
have the interpretation incorrect?  Or did you create the functionality 
as you did for another reason?
>> Could I do this by just adding energy when thrust is turned on/off, 
        and modeling the thrust as another term in the 'total' gravity?

User-selectable skater/vehicle graphics.
Crashing skater?

add spanish

Add game-ish modes to sk8r application
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?

Bug: When user drags track that skater is resting on, the skater doesn't move with it.

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.
__

In my brief play I found a bug ... in the attached screen shot the
skater doesn't fall off the track even though he gets completely off the edge.
__

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

Optional to overlay a position-grid on the real space (to correlate with graph).
    Like moving man, force1d or ramps, disabled by default.

Add clipping to energy vs position plot (so data doesn't fall outside the data area).
>>We decided against this for wave interference on the grounds that:
1. It is not confusing.
2. It actually shows data that would be otherwise hidden.
We haven't yet gathered interview results for this; we should revise the plan here after interviews.

Record, then playback, then record deletes the first record sequence.  This may be a good default, but it occurred unexpectedly in the bugfix:
>>Bugfix: Setting record, then live, then record resets to last record state.

One question I have is were we going to have a mystery planet where 
they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...

Bug: Wiggle me appears when moving the slider.
>>is this fixed?

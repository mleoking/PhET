Can you fix start up loading window to read Energy Skate Park (right now it reads Energy S8ter)?
>>Maybe needs to be done for the main-site jnlp file.

On my computer the skater guy can start smooth but gets into a very jerky motion (extremely reproducible ... I just take the original U-track, grab the right-hand point, drag it down so it is a ramp going, then guy's motion becomes very jerky when he gets near the bottom of this track)... I don't think this was the way he worked before? (I checked and it's not a problem on 0.16 for instance). (This one needs to be fixed before posting I think). 

The man is a lot darker than he used to be, he seems like he's always in the shadow. 

I still would very much like an optional grid... It would help in measuring heights and such . (I see it on the low priority list, but as I consider how you'd use it for measurements, I feel like it would be a beneficial addition).

Crashing skater?

Add game-ish modes to sk8r application
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?

Bug: When user drags track that skater is resting on, the skater doesn't move with it.

One solution (which I think would be nice) ... would be to have the
optional grid on the play area and then the show the same grid on the
energy vs position graphs... so if the grid spacing were every meter
then there would be a faint grid in the background of the plot as
well as the background of the play area that was every meter.  This
way they don't have to be the same "scale" but you can still make the
connection.  The ruler and the graph match so it seems like it
wouldn't be that hard program wise???

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.
__

I can't remember the idea exactly, but looking at the sim again, I do
think it would be a good option... not a default.  It will allow you
to make nice tracks ... e.g. if I start the guy at this line then he
will only rise to that same line or he will get over the hill as long
as the hill is below that line... it gives you reference heights ...
I would make them some nice increments.. like every 1 or 2 meters,
and make them pretty dim.

In my brief play I found a bug ... in the attached screen shot the
skater doesn't fall off the track even though he gets completely off the edge.

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

Optional to overlay a position-grid on the real space (to correlate with graph).
    Like moving man, force1d or ramps, disabled by default.

Add clipping to energy vs position plot (so data doesn't fall outside the data area).
>>We decided against this for wave interference on the grounds that:
1. It is not confusing.
2. It actually shows data that would be otherwise hidden.
We haven't yet gathered interview results for this; we should revise the plan here after interviews.

Record, then playback, then record deletes the first record sequence.  This may be a good default, but it occurred unexpectedly in the bugfix:
>>Bugfix: Setting record, then live, then record resets to last record state.

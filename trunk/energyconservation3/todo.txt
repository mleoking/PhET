Record, pause, switch location, go doesn't keep the switch location.

go, pause, switch, go might also have the same problem

Pausing 'go' then pressing 'playback' should have 'slow' enabled.

In E vs. T graph, rescaling the y axis shouldn't center on the E=0 axis.
 
For E vs T. graph (and maybe other graphs), should have moving man style zoom buttons.
        
after record/playback/reset, there is a hidden track graphic or something...  I get a cursor hand when I mouse over it.

energy vs. time chart not big enough to see all the data

When the user clicks on a track  (for a right-click menu or to drag it), it thinks the user is dragging the spline, so doesn't work to conserve energy.

If left on and the yellow dots of the path record allowed to accumulate, it 
seems to cause tremendous lag in the program (maybe set a limit on how long it can be 
left on?)

Sometimes the skater gets stuck.
        Difficult to reproduce.
        Could try searching ahead a few steps to see if the skater will get stuck...

One run caused the skater to behave as if he had 0.001 mass (in space).  Couldn't reproduce.

1.  The values for energy show up under the yellow record dots so you can't read the values.

2.  I was wondering why there are buttons that say 'zoom out' and 'zoom in' on the Energy vs. Position graph rather than our standard magnifying glass buttons.

3.  When I choose copy on this same graph, I get a window with a copy but that window will disappear behind everything else as soon as I click on anything associated with the simulation.  Can you make it stay forward like the other windows do?

4.  I'm not sure how this copy is supposed to function but it has the same graph at the bottom half of the window and the top half (ok 60%) is black but includes data that goes off scale on the original Energy vs. Position graph.  Is this the idea?

5. Reset does not get rid of the tape measure if you have it out.

6. The skater sticks to the track when traveling in a loop at a speed that would never allow him to stay on the track.  He would crash on his head for sure.  I can create a loop where he falls off as he comes to the top, bounces off the track below and then sticks to the track above him again

This picture shows him after he bounces on his head because he fell off the track as he was traveling to the left upside down.  He still has an upward velocity in this picture.  He will get to the track and stay on after this show.  He keeps repeating this path indefinitely.

7. The potential Energy Reference line is Red but potential energy on the graphs is blue.

Fix "ignore thermal" to be "show thermal", on by default.

Clear thermal when manipulating the skater.

"Record Path" should be the button label, clear can still be next to it.

"Record Path" should be a button, not a checkbox.

"Record Path" button should be moved after the tool checkboxes.

move "record path" so it's not next to "return skater"

Put "track friction" instead of "friction" as the label for the friction button.

>>We had to assume the grass acts like the ramp and that was a conceptual issue. The team has talked about changing the ground to look like the ramp to help. Right now, the two sims treat grass differently and that should be resolved.

He should have at least 1/2mgr (where r is radius of curvature of track) worth of kinetic energy to be able to stick to it (when he is vertical). Right now his stickiness doesn't seem to be affected by the local r.
 
 Resetting the skater should clear thermal.
 
I'm still leaning towards the world ending when he goes off one side or the
other.  I can't see value in tracking his actions when we can't see him.  On
top of that, we reset things when he is returned.  I think as soon as the
return skater label appears, students realize they have fallen out of range
and need to start again.
 >>Maybe we should pause the simulation when he moves off?
 >>Or maybe we should add walls?
 >>Or maybe we should have the camera follow him when he moves off?
  >>I think it would be confusing to have different physics based on whether the camera can see the skater.
  >>A popup that says "landed on grass"

Default should show thermal for pie chart.

Should the pie chart button be by the other charting options?

getNormalForce( double x, Body body )  in SplineMode is sometimes pulling the skater to the track.

Dropping from a height, sometimes the skater gets stuck in the ground
    I think we discussed this and decided it's okay to leave this.

arrow keys in space makes him vanish on one run...
        Couldn't Reproduce this.

User-selectable skater/vehicle graphics.

Crashing skater?

add spanish

Add game-ish modes to sk8r application
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.
        Is this problem resolved?

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

One question I have is were we going to have a mystery planet where 
they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...

Jetpack is shown in an incorrect position when the character is on the track.

-If curvature of the track is too great (not gradual enough) the skater
cannot move passed
the vertex and will bounce off of it.
        This only happens if it's not 'rollercoaster mode' and if the skater flys away from the track.
        
- slow motion button doesn't seem to work right
        Clarifying...
        
-If the skater goes off screen and the user is holding down an arrow key
when they click "bring back the skater" or "return skater" the skater will return and
immediately start thrusting in that direction regardless of what arrow keys are or are not
being pushed.  The only way to fix this is to reset the entire simulation.
        We couldn't reproduce this.
        
After some combination of recording and playback, the track graphic becomes dissociated from the skater.
        The skater will continue to traverse the path where the track used to be, even after it has been dragged.
        This solution is a bit of a hack.

Save/Load not working sometimes
        Could be: throwing an exception, "body.debug angles inconsistent"
        This may be fixed now; I was unable to reproduce the problem so I can't claim this with much certainty.

-When coefficient of friction is turned to maximum and there is a lot of
gravity (maximum) the skater falls through the track at the bottom point and
bounces around the bottom of the screen before shooting off in a random direction 
(his exact reaction varies each time).
        This problem is partially reduced.  Friction + Gravity + Track Curvature increases probability of getting this problem.
        
after record/playback/reset, then gravity in space, friction is not working
	This is correct behaivor.
	
Does BackgroundScreenNode depend on using same instance of floor graphic?
>>that's ok, we're reusing instance.

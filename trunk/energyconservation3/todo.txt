Bug: When user drags track that skater is resting on, the skater doesn't move with it.

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.

In my brief play I found a bug ... in the attached screen shot the
skater doesn't fall off the track even though he gets completely off the edge.

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

Optional to overlay a position-grid on the real space (to correlate with graph).
    Like moving man, force1d or ramps, disabled by default.

Add clipping to energy vs position plot (so data doesn't fall outside the data area).
>>We decided against this for wave interference on the grounds that:
1. It is not confusing.
2. It actually shows data that would be otherwise hidden.
We haven't yet gathered interview results for this; we should revise the plan here after interviews.

Record, then playback, then record deletes the first record sequence.  This may be a good default, but it occurred unexpectedly in the bugfix:
>>Bugfix: Setting record, then live, then record resets to last record state.

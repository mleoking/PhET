After some combination of recording and playback, the track graphic becomes dissociated from the skater.
        The skater will continue to traverse the path where the track used to be, ever after it has been dragged.
        
Is the skater's physics correct as a function of mass?

-When coefficient of friction is turned to maximum and there is a lot of
gravity (maximum) the skater falls through the track at the bottom point and
bounces around the bottom of the screen
before shooting off in a random direction (his exact reaction varies each
time).

-A mass of 0.0 kg can be selected for the skater who will then disappear and
cannot be
brought back without setting the mass above zero even if the "Return Skater"
button is
clicked. (maybe include an error message explaining how the mass of the
skater cannot be
zero)

-If the friction menu is opened or the skater reset during the simulation
the arrow keys to
control thrust will scroll (up and down) the side menu as well (as far as I
know this does
NOT happen with the Skater Properties menu).
        Make the friction slider not respond to keypress

-Skater can bounce off the ground and continue to do so if the track is set
as a straight
line into the ground (also occurs if the vertex of the track is brought
below the ground ).
        Skater should continue to traverse the track while underground.

-If the skater goes off screen and the user is holding down an arrow key
when they click
"bring back the skater" or "return skater" the skater will return and
immediately start
thrusting in that direction regardless of what arrow keys are or are not
being pushed.  The
only way to fix this is to reset the entire simulation.
        We couldn't reproduce this.

Load is throwing an exception, "body.debug angles inconsistent"
        This may be fixed now, I had trouble reproducing this problem.
               
- slow motion button doesn't seem to work right
        Clarifying...

User-selectable skater/vehicle graphics.
Crashing skater?

add spanish

Add game-ish modes to sk8r application
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?

Bug: When user drags track that skater is resting on, the skater doesn't move with it.

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.
__

In my brief play I found a bug ... in the attached screen shot the
skater doesn't fall off the track even though he gets completely off the edge.
__

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

Optional to overlay a position-grid on the real space (to correlate with graph).
    Like moving man, force1d or ramps, disabled by default.

Add clipping to energy vs position plot (so data doesn't fall outside the data area).
>>We decided against this for wave interference on the grounds that:
1. It is not confusing.
2. It actually shows data that would be otherwise hidden.
We haven't yet gathered interview results for this; we should revise the plan here after interviews.

Record, then playback, then record deletes the first record sequence.  This may be a good default, but it occurred unexpectedly in the bugfix:
>>Bugfix: Setting record, then live, then record resets to last record state.

One question I have is were we going to have a mystery planet where 
they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...

Bug: Wiggle me appears when moving the slider.
>>is this fixed?

Jetpack is shown in an incorrect position when the character is on the track.

-If curvature of the track is too great (not gradual enough) the skater
cannot move passed
the vertex and will bounce off of it.
        This only happens if it's not 'rollercoaster mode' and if the skater flys away from the track.

I went to change the track and the guy froze in mid air. 
I move the track around some more an he eventually started up again. 
I found out that this can be repeated; he freezes when you raise the track. 
It happens when there is only the original track and if you add another piece too. 
I restarted the sim and could get him to freeze easily as well, so its not just after running for a while.

The skater gets stuck in a track sometimes (bounces back and forth, centered on the track)

Add friction for bounces, when friction is enbled.

Jetpack is shown in an incorrect position when the character is on the track.

Are history buttons displaying total energy without thermal, and calling it total?

Track graphic is stopping one segment before the end of the track.

I was trying to simulate gravity using a downward thrust on the skater, 
and it essentially works, but it appears that the thrust is not 
constant, perhaps, but increases a little if you hold down the down 
arrow?  I was thinking that the desired functionality would be that a 
constant push on the down arrow would provide a constant thrust, and 
therefore the skater, with no friction, would simply replicate the 
affect in a gravitational field.  This would be a great way to show that 
gravity can not be distinguished from an accelerating frame of 
reference.  But, in the current simulation, even without friction the 
motion is damped and KE goes to zero (over a long period of time).  Do I 
have the interpretation incorrect?  Or did you create the functionality 
as you did for another reason?

User-selectable skater/vehicle graphics.
Crashing skater?

add spanish

Add game-ish modes to sk8r application
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?

Bug: When user drags track that skater is resting on, the skater doesn't move with it.

Another bug ...
The sim was running in the background for the last hour or so, and
now when I bring it to the foreground I can't get it to redraw it's
screen .. it's all white until I mouse over sections, but even then
it's erratic whether it will redraw or not.
__

In my brief play I found a bug ... in the attached screen shot the
skater doesn't fall off the track even though he gets completely off the edge.
__

Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint,
the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.

Optional to overlay a position-grid on the real space (to correlate with graph).
    Like moving man, force1d or ramps, disabled by default.

Add clipping to energy vs position plot (so data doesn't fall outside the data area).
>>We decided against this for wave interference on the grounds that:
1. It is not confusing.
2. It actually shows data that would be otherwise hidden.
We haven't yet gathered interview results for this; we should revise the plan here after interviews.

Record, then playback, then record deletes the first record sequence.  This may be a good default, but it occurred unexpectedly in the bugfix:
>>Bugfix: Setting record, then live, then record resets to last record state.

One question I have is were we going to have a mystery planet where 
they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...

Bug: Wiggle me appears when moving the slider.
>>is this fixed?

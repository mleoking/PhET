-Changes for 0.00.20
Changed the look and feel to platform specific.
Bugfix: The scale for the readings on the path data is unreadably huge.
Made the view of history point data toggle-based, so 2 can be visible at once.
Added a warning box to the reset button that says, Are you sure you want to reset?
Bugfix: Removed the ability to drag (pan/zoom) the bar graph graphics.
Removed the minimize button from the bar chart.
Removed the "Total Energy" entry from the pie chart legend.
Added a "Clear Heat" button to the bar graph window.
Bugfix: When minimizing and restoring the window, the chart & graph windows don't restore their state.
Bugfix: The charts all flash up on the screen for a second during startup.

-Changes for 0.00.19 (5-14-2006)
The simulation is now titled 'Energy Skate Park'
The skater's potential energy is now zero when he's on the ground (by default).
The skater cannot be dragged outside the window, or below ground.

-Changes for 1-2-2006, 0.17
“Play” has been changed to “Go” for clarity.
Add a movable “zero-point potential energy” graphic
Add a clear button to e vs t graph in skater.
Remove "minimize" button from e vs t in skater.
Background is on by default
Improved backgrounds a bit (tone down, position properly)

-Changes for 12-23-2005, 0.15
Paused shows up in the play area when skater is paused.
Renamed “Live” to “Play”
Radio buttons match slider values. (all off when no exact location).
Energy vs. Time chart comes up recording.
Added color code legend for pie chart.
Energy vs Position graph has a color-coded legend.
Energy vs Position graph doesn't fade during pause.
Renamed “Coefficient of Restitution” to “bounciness” 
Reset starts module running (not paused)
Reset button changes the values in “edit skater”
Save graphs (e.g. to compare friction on to friction off).

-Changes for 11-17-2005, 0.13
Fix playback panel button sizes for 1024x768.
Move Energy vs position button near other plot buttons.
Rename 'show plot' to Plot Energy vs Time

Make object mass switchable.
Add a control for coeff of restitution.
Fix horizontal range on Energy vs Position graphs.
Turned model and view upside down.
Paint like Jupiter/Earth/Moon/Space.

-Changes for 11-14-2005, 0.10
Added performance enhancements for energy-position graph
Added a vertical location indicator in energy-position graph
Bugfix: A bounce entails a loss of energy (which I didn't intend).
Add coefficient of restitution.

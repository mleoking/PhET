1.02.14
Bugfix: History buttons are displaying total energy without thermal, and calling it total.
    Added a thermal energy readout, and fix the total energy value to reflect all energy (not just mechanical energy).

1.02.13 (11-10-2006)
Set the bounciness to correspond to the bounciness slider.
Set the minimum mass of the skater to 1.0 kg.
Fixed a bug that caused save/load to fail sometimes.

1.02.12 (11-8-2006)
Bugfix: When you move from space to earth the "use arrow keys to thrust" stays up.
Bugfix: When I pulled up energy vs time graph, and messed around with pausing, using cursor, and trying to go again ... it got confused. (Right now I can't get the guy to start moving again ... even when I hit Reset.)
Added friction for bounces, when friction is enabled.
            Added coefficient of restitution as a nonlinear function of friction coefficient.
Added insurance that the skater won't pass through a spline while in free-fall.
Removed some bogus collision code (for handling ends of spline).
Added code that prevents the skater from bouncing back and forth centered on a track.
Added save/load for splines & skaters.
Added roller-coaster mode (sticky tracks).
Deleted some spline traversal code that caused the skater to get stuck. 

1.02.11 (11-3-2006)
Made the "Return The Skater" button pop up when the skater is partially offscreen (rather than when he is completely offscreen).
Bugfix: The man jiggles around when on a nearly horizontal piece of track.

1.02.10 (11-3-2006)
Added a "Step" button to playback, live, and record modes.
Added another mechanism to reduce energy errors in spline traversal mode.
            This prevents the problem where the skater gets stuck at a high point at slow velocity.

1.02.09 (11-2-2006)
Improvements in spline traversal.
Consolidate top/bottom splines.
Rewrote Track Toolbox to work at different scales.
Track Toolbox code is more elegant.
Fixed: Dragging a control point of the skater's track can cause him to freeze.
Fixed: Track graphic is stopping one segment before the end of the track.

1.02.08 (10-25-2006)
Removed track graphic at ground-level.
Added friction to ground.
Added preliminary collision code to avoid getting stuck in a track (needs more testing).

1.02.07 (10-18-2006)

1.02.06 (10-18-2006)
Added improved frame sizes for deployment
Added tests
Bugfix in spline traversal (if error is too high, rollback change, don't use global energy)

1.02.05 (10-18-2006)
Rewrote spline traversal physics.
Added tests.

1.02.03 (10-11-2006)
Added smoothing for spline traversal (to smooth out jerkiness e.g. at bottom of parabola)
Added code so the skater can fall off of spline when his velocity dotted with the unit normal of the segment is positive.
Found an instance of unconserved energy and remedied it.
Bugfix: pressing go after playing back a sequence inverts the angle.
Bugfix: Jet pack isn't visible after reset.
Bugfix: When I go to space or set gravity to zero, if I don't use the arrows before I hit RESET, the arrow keys don't work. 
        For example, if you go to space and then hit Reset, the arrows work the far right slider.
Bugfix:  If you use the space simulation, and change to gravity and back, sometimes (can't be sure how exactly) the thruster/jets don't show on the skater in space mode, though he does move as if they are firing.  
        Seems like the simulation of his jet pack is not quite getting reset.       

1.02.02 (10-11-2006)
Bugfix: When he's stationary and the track is moved he doesn't fall.
Bugfix: When he's oscillating on the track and I lift the track up the skater 
            can end up oscillating back and forth, as if a track was there, but 
            it's not really there.
Fixed a memory leak.
Bugfix: 'Reset Skater' turns him upside down sometimes.
Bugfix: Reset doesn't work any more ... the skater is just frozen (and the 
            red dot doesn't go with him).
Bugfix: After a long time, the man is stopped and when I tried to grab him, all I could move around 
            was the little red dot, not the actual skater.

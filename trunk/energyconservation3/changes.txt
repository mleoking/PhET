1.02.03
Added smoothing for spline traversal (to smooth out jerkiness e.g. at bottom of parabola)
Added code so the skater can fall off of spline when his velocity dotted with the unit normal of the segment is positive.
Found an instance of unconserved energy and remedied it.
Bugfix: pressing go after playing back a sequence inverts the angle.
Bugfix: When I go to space or set gravity to zero, if I don't use the arrows before I hit RESET, the arrow keys don't work. 
        For example, if you go to space and then hit Reset, the arrows work the far right slider.

1.02.02 (10-11-2006)
Bugfix: When he's stationary and the track is moved he doesn't fall.
Bugfix: When he's oscillating on the track and I lift the track up the skater 
            can end up oscillating back and forth, as if a track was there, but 
            it's not really there.
Fixed a memory leak.
Bugfix: 'Reset Skater' turns him upside down sometimes.
Bugfix: Reset doesn't work any more ... the skater is just frozen (and the 
            red dot doesn't go with him).
Bugfix: After a long time, the man is stopped and when I tried to grab him, all I could more around 
            was the little red dot, not the actual skater.

Increased the initial and "return" height of the skater; increased the initial track to ensure a smooth first ride.

-Changes for 0.00.20
Changed the look and feel to platform specific.
Bugfix: The scale for the readings on the path data is unreadably huge.

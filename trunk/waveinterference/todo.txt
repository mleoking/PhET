o Intensity readers should be constrained on the x-axis when in side-view.

o Real-time model won't work when paused (wavelength comes out wrong).

o Add vector view to photon view.

o Add full field to photon-view?
    This would require a major rewrite of the model (which is now 2-d and nonvectorial).  Is this really what we want here?

o Should we show intensity readouts anywhere, or just wave values?

o How to control frequency/amplitude when there are two wave sources?

o We could get rid of edge effects by maintining a higher lattice than is shown on the screen.

o Add correct units to measuring tape.

o Add correct units to stopwatch.

o Make it so "pause" then "step" uses a sensible dt (not the actual system delay)

o Intensity readers should be constrained on the x-axis when in side-view.

o Should we show intensity readouts anywhere, or just wave values?

o The single frequency/amplitude controller should control both oscillators when there are 2.

o When there are 2 wave sources, they should always be in phase.

o Show intensity on the screen as default
    Optionally show fluctuations.

o We could get rid of edge effects by maintining a higher lattice than is shown on the screen.

o Add correct units to measuring tape.

o Add correct units to stopwatch.

o Barrier, multiple sources should disappear for rotate wave.

Probably right. Maybe rotate wave should be grayed out with barrier or
multiple sources - otherwise, it will seem strange that all these things
disappear when you rotate.

o Intensity readout titles should depend on the module e.g. "E-Field"

- The speaker should move when creating the sound wave (at least, the
speaker cone should move).

- It looks like the particles run away from the speaker and then fill in
from behind. I know this is sort of an optical illusion, but there may be a
way to minimize this visual effect. I tried to follow a single particle and
it still looked like it was running away.

-  When you change the wavelength of light, it resets rather than continuing
with differently colored ripples. Also, when you turn the gun off, it goes
to solid color rather than black. Also, I'd rather have a flashlight than a
gun, unless there is a compelling reason to make it a gun (besides
supporting the military-industrial complex).

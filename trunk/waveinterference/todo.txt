Remaining Work
##############################################################

o Should be able to view sound waves and light waves from the side.(Sound and Light show same thing on side as on top)
For 3-d waves (sound & light), rotation should be disabled when there are asymmetries (barriers, multiple sources, etc.)
Hold off on the message "rotate to top view to use this" until we interview.
>>Awaiting feedback on implementation for light.

o Test at 1024x768

o Test on a Mac.

o Add foreign languages.

o Add help?

o Dotted line should be white in sound module for particle view.

Bug: When you turn the gun off, it goes to solid color rather than black.

Questions
##############################################################
o Add correct units to measuring tape.
o Add correct units to stopwatch.
>>How do you like the present units?

Move crosshairs up to center on graph.
>>This could be difficult, and maybe putting space between the crosshairs and the graph is sufficient.

I implemented dragging for the faucets, should I also do this for other wave sources?

Should wave sources be draggable in all directions?  Right now single sources can move horizontally and pairs can move vertically (independently).

Low Priority

- It looks like the particles run away from the speaker and then fill in
from behind. I know this is sort of an optical illusion, but there may be a
way to minimize this visual effect. I tried to follow a single particle and
it still looked like it was running away.

Do we want to optionally show absolute values (or intensities) in the wave area
(to give a more global idea of constructive and destructive interference)?
o I would leave it up to others whether we should show intensity in the wave
itself. I don't really have an opinion, but I would lean towards not doing
this, since there are already a lot of controls in this sim and I'm not sure
what this option would buy us. Maybe in an advanced pull-down menu??
>>This looks like it wouldn't be a useful feature.  I'll drop it for now.

Pressure waves are out of phase (particles are too slow to keep up with pressure).
- I did notice that - I was going to mention that high pressure should be
where the particles are dense. Right now it looks 180 deg. out of phase.
>>I switched the phase by 180 degrees, still slightly off, but maybe good enough?

o Right now audio is implemented to play the audio directly at the speaker (not a distance from the speaker.)  Should we add 'listener' mode, as in 'sound waves' simulation?
    >>not now.

I noticed that when the graph is on, there is a dotted line across the pool.
I like that. Maybe the edge of the rotating box should also be dotted? I
mean the edge that is the same as where the dotted line appears (which is
also the axis of rotation). I suppose if the top and sides of the box are
polygons that might be hard to do.

Last thing. Is it possible to make the dotted line appear when you click on
the view angle slider? What I envision is that you click on the slider and
the dotted line appears on the pool, stays dotted as the edge of the
rotating box, and disappears when you release the slider. Just an idea, but
I wouldn't spend any time on it for now. Just wondering if it is possible.

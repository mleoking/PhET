 Rotation:
o Barrier, multiple sources should disappear for rotate wave in water module.
 What we’ve come up with is to rotate a box that has the horizontal cross section as one face and the vertical crosssection as another face.
 >>See email.
 All three views will rotate (Sound and Light show same thing on side as on top)
>I'm not sure how to visualize the intermediate graphics for sound & light.
-I think the idea is that it will look just like the intermediate graphics
look right now. It's just that when it flips over to "side" it will look the
same as "top". This is because both sound and light waves are the same from
all angles.
>Not sure I want to handle what to do with barriers, sources in these cases.
>Maybe we should disallow rotation here, and refer users to the 3-d falstad wave simulations..?
>>Delete rotation for light & sound.
o Should be able to view sound waves and light waves from the side.
For 3-d waves (sound & light), rotation should be disabled when there are asymmetries (barriers, multiple sources, etc.)

Units:
On all panels the graph x-axis units need to represent a realistic number.
The measuring tape already does this so for each panel if you could match the
 units on the graph to what the tape measure uses. For the y-axis, simple tick marks with no numbers or units will work.

o Test at 1024x768

o Test on a Mac.

o Add foreign languages.

o Add help?

o Add correct units to measuring tape.

o Right now audio is implemented to play the audio directly at the speaker (not a distance from the speaker.)  Should we add 'listener' mode, as in 'sound waves' simulation?

o Add correct units to stopwatch.

o When a barrier is present, it should be shown in side view as behind the wave.

o Faucets should be draggable.

Particle View
    - When you put up a barrier in sound, the particles to the right of the
barrier don't go through (this is correct), but the particles on the left of
the barrier penetrate the barrier. I suspect that there is a boundary
condition on the right side, but not the left?

On the sound panel the current particle view is too large and there’s only one red molecule.
Let’s use the size of molecules that corresponded to 0.6 on your previous version using the same number of red
molecules that were displayed on that version.
For some reason the current version is very slow. Something needs to be done to improve performance on this panel.

Bug: When you turn the gun off, it goes to solid color rather than black.

Would it help speed things up to make the particles smaller? They could be
maybe 75% of their current size and it might look better anyway.
 I would pick a smaller particle size for the particle view.  Probably half
your current size or a little smaller.

Have the bar that connects to the faucets be silver like the faucets and
frame of control box. On the speaker the current color doesn't look bad at
all.  For the light I'd also change to a grey.

Detectors: the graph obscures the wave right in front of the crosshairs,
I thought we were going to move the crosshairs to handle this (top center)?
I thought we were going to detach the crosshairs from the readouts.

o Graphs need to be cropped.
>>Should graphs really be cropped?  Is this just for visual appeal?

I noticed that when the graph is on, there is a dotted line across the pool.
I like that. Maybe the edge of the rotating box should also be dotted? I
mean the edge that is the same as where the dotted line appears (which is
also the axis of rotation). I suppose if the top and sides of the box are
polygons that might be hard to do.

Last thing. Is it possible to make the dotted line appear when you click on
the view angle slider? What I envision is that you click on the slider and
the dotted line appears on the pool, stays dotted as the edge of the
rotating box, and disappears when you release the slider. Just an idea, but
I wouldn't spend any time on it for now. Just wondering if it is possible.

Low Priority________________________________________________________
- It looks like the particles run away from the speaker and then fill in
from behind. I know this is sort of an optical illusion, but there may be a
way to minimize this visual effect. I tried to follow a single particle and
it still looked like it was running away.

Do we want to optionally show absolute values (or intensities) in the wave area
(to give a more global idea of constructive and destructive interference)?
o I would leave it up to others whether we should show intensity in the wave
itself. I don't really have an opinion, but I would lean towards not doing
this, since there are already a lot of controls in this sim and I'm not sure
what this option would buy us. Maybe in an advanced pull-down menu??
>>This looks like it wouldn't be a useful feature.  I'll drop it for now.

Make the view angle box narrower.
>>This is currently very difficult.  Maybe I should forget it for now.

- Issue with the light source. (you need coherent
light to get interference). The way this is actually done (I think) is to
shine a laser through a single slit (or pinhole) and make the light
diffract, creating circular wavefronts. Also a problem of scale, since the
light should be ~500nm.  Maybe none of this matters, but it's something I
noticed and should be solved if there is an easy solution.
>>We can leave this as a lamp source for now.  Let me know if we think of something better.

Pressure waves are out of phase (particles are too slow to keep up with pressure).
- I did notice that - I was going to mention that high pressure should be
where the particles are dense. Right now it looks 180 deg. out of phase.
>>I switched the phase by 180 degrees, still slightly off, but maybe good enough?

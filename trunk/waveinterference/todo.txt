o Intensity readers should be constrained on the x-axis when in side-view.

o Should we show intensity readouts anywhere, or just wave values?
6. Could show intensity on detectors instead of displacement (ask Noah P)
Okay, I'll add a switch to detectors to show intensity.  Do we want to optionally show absolute values (or intensities) in the wave area (to give a more global idea of constructive and destructive interference)?
> I would leave it up to others whether we should show intensity in the wave
itself. I don't really have an opinion, but I would lean towards not doing
this, since there are already a lot of controls in this sim and I'm not sure
what this option would buy us. Maybe in an advanced pull-down menu??

o Add correct units to measuring tape.

o Add correct units to stopwatch.

o Barrier, multiple sources should disappear for rotate wave.

Wave Interference: notes from phet meeting 4-4-06
4. When a barrier is present, it should be shown in side view as behind the wave.
5. Show a dotted gray line on intermediate rotation graphic to signify the cross section.
7. Faucets should be draggable.
8. In particle mode, there should be a smaller number of red particles.
10. For the photon panel, users should be able to view with or without arrow vectors.
11. Should be able to view sound waves from the side.
12. Photon vectors should not have their tail fixed at E=0, but their middle,
    so students don't confuse "y" with "E"

    - When you put up a barrier in sound, the particles to the right of the
barrier don't go through (this is correct), but the particles on the left of
the barrier penetrate the barrier. I suspect that there is a boundary
condition on the right side, but not the left?

- Issue with the light source. (you need coherent
light to get interference). The way this is actually done (I think) is to
shine a laser through a single slit (or pinhole) and make the light
diffract, creating circular wavefronts. Also a problem of scale, since the
light should be ~500nm.  Maybe none of this matters, but it's something I
noticed and should be solved if there is an easy solution.

- It looks like the particles run away from the speaker and then fill in
from behind. I know this is sort of an optical illusion, but there may be a
way to minimize this visual effect. I tried to follow a single particle and
it still looked like it was running away.

-  When you change the wavelength of light, it resets rather than continuing
with differently colored ripples.

When you turn the gun off, it goes to solid color rather than black.

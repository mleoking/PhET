New in 0.00.13
Relabeled 'View Angle' to 'Rotate View'
Moved measuring tape in front of charts.
Removed vertical tick labels from charts.
Synchronized chart horizontal units & measuring tape units.
Vector view: arrows are fixed at zero (since it's in a graph).
When a barrier is present, it is shown in side view as behind the wave (water only).
Performance problem for particle view (visible in 0.00.12) has disappeared (unknown reason).
Faucets are draggable.
Particle View:
    Reverted from one red particle to 5% red particles.
    Reduced particle size.
    Particles no longer go through the barrier wall.

New in 0.00.12 (5-15-2006)
Fixed a glitch in the intermediate rotation graphic that made edges not line up.
Photon Vector View:
    Reduced the number of vectors in photon vector view to about 1/3.
    Removed the black outline and have hollow vectors with a colored outline.
    The outline should be about twice as thick as it is now
    Removed the one black vector.

New in 0.00.10 (5-15-2006)
Photons are red by default.
Added a 'clear wave' button to each control panel.
Added audio to the sound module
Made rotation glyph cut off at cross section
Removed dotted line cross section graphic.

New in 0.08
Added a dotted gray line on intermediate rotation graphic to signify the cross section.
Bugfix: Cross section graphic shouldn't show in side-view (water waves only).
Sound Module:
    Made it so just one particle is pink, always in front.
    Changed particle view background to black.
Light Module:
    Can view with or without arrow vectors.
Added smoothmetal UI (optional)
    
New in 0.07 (4-15-2006)
Water color is lighter  (easier to see on projector)
Drips disappear immediately when hitting the water (in side view)
Wave sources have on/off radio buttons.
Frequency & Amplitude sliders are non-numeric.
Frequency & Amplitude sliders are attached to the wave source, and colorized.
Frequency & Amplitude sliders control both wave sources.
Buttons switch from Grayscale to Particle View in Sound Module instead of slider for magnification.
The speaker cone moves.
Light Module: Source graphic is now a theater lamp.
Light Module: Show Screen option is reduced.
Light Module: Added Intensity Graph.
Light Module: Intensity is plotted rather than displacement.
Tools are at the top of the control panel.
Added thumnails to control panel.
Improved View Angle slider.
Improved Barrier controls.
Barriers are draggable horizontally.
Labels are module-specific.
Detectors have 'x' close buttons.
Removed detector options button.
Added a wave area graph.
Added a dotted midline to show cross-section for wave area graph.
Added an increased lattice size, for reduced boundary problems.

New in 0.05 (4-4-2006)
Reduced the size of intensity readers.
Added vector view to photons.
Decreased amplitude of side-views.
Reduced the fraction of pink particles in particle view.

New in 0.04 (3-31-2006)
Fixed wave area to shrink to fit window size.
Changed clock to run independent of system time.  This means pause & step work correctly, and time values are correct on detector readouts (still sans units).

New in 0.03 (3-29-2006)
Added water, sound and light tabs.

New in 0.01
Initialized wave interference project.

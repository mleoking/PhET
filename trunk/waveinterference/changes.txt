Water color is lighter  (easier to see on projector)
Drips disappear immediately when hitting the water (in side view)
Wave sources have on/off radio buttons.
Frequency & Amplitude sliders are non-numeric.
Frequency & Amplitude sliders are attached to the wave source, and colorized.
Frequency & Amplitude sliders control both wave sources.
Buttons switch from Grayscale to Particle View in Sound Module instead of slider for magnification.
The speaker cone moves.
Light Module: Source graphic is now a theater lamp.
Light Module: Show Screen option is reduced.
Light Module: Added Intensity Graph.
Light Module: Intensity is plotted rather than displacement.
Tools are at the top of the control panel.
Added thumnails to control panel.
Improved View Angle slider.
Improved Barrier controls.
Barriers are draggable horizontally.
Labels are module-specific.
Detectors have 'x' close buttons.
Removed detector options button.
Added a wave area graph.
Added a dotted midline to show cross-section for wave area graph.
Added an increased lattice size, for reduced boundary problems.

Reduced the size of intensity readers.
Added vector view to photons.
Decreased amplitude of side-views.
Reduced the fraction of pink particles in particle view.

Fixed wave area to shrink to fit window size.
Changed clock to run independent of system time.  This means pause & step work correctly, and time values are correct on detector readouts (still sans units).

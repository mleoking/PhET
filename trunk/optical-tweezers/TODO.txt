"To Do" list for "Optical Tweezers" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- learn more about optical tweezers

HIGH PRIORITY:
- model view transform
- save/load for first module's control panel
- wire up "Return Bead" button
- liquid model
- connect glass slide view to model
- bead model
- bead view
- laser model
- laser view
- laser control panel

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- make FluidControlPanel observe and update model
- constrain bead drag
- dynamically adjust glass slide width based on play area width
- laser power range is 0-1000 mW
- units and range for slow speed
- units and range for fast speed
- range for flow velocity
- units and range for fluid viscosity
- units and range for fluid temperature
- get requirements for "Fun With DNA" and "Molecular Motors" panels
- get details of physical model

LOW PRIORITY:
- green control panel background
- package level javadoc

DEFER UNTIL AFTER INTERVIEWS:
 
DONE:
(2/6/07) - fluid control panel
(2/6/07) - add ad hoc view of bead (no connection to model, no drag constraints)
(2/6/07) - add ad hoc view of glass slide (no connection to model)
(2/5/07) - implement "reset all" for first module
(2/5/07) - wire up first control panel to show/hide controls properly
(2/5/07) - create a separate "default values" class for each module
(2/5/07) - add all Swing components to first control panel, no wiring
(2/5/07) - add entries in CVS modules and loginfo
(2/5/07) - sim requires charts, add dependencies on jfreechart and jfreechart-phet
(2/5/07) - remove speed slider from clock control panel
(1/29/07) - set up ProGuard
(1/29/07) - set up dev directory
(1/29/07) - create JNLP files
(1/29/07) - set up basic application framework (modules, control panels, clock controls, persistence, etc)
(1/29/07) - set up project in CVS

REJECTED:

"To Do" list for "Optical Tweezers" simulation          $Revision$
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- learn more about optical tweezers

HIGH PRIORITY:
- laser power text field entry and validation
- laser view
- make FluidControlPanel observer of Fluid


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- vertically align left edges of fluid controls
- generalize LaserPowerControl
- use font in FluidControlPanel
- wire up "Return Bead" button
- liquid model
- connect glass slide view to model
- bead model
- laser model
- make FluidControlPanel observe and update model
- constrain bead drag
- dynamically adjust glass slide width based on play area width
- units and range for slow speed
- units and range for fast speed
- range for flow velocity
- units and range for fluid viscosity
- units and range for fluid temperature
- get requirements for "Fun With DNA" and "Molecular Motors" panels
- get details of physical model

LOW PRIORITY:
- save/load for first module's control panel
- green control panel background
- package level javadoc
- make laser danger sign look better
- combine Play & Pause clock buttons ?

DEFER UNTIL AFTER INTERVIEWS:
 
DONE:
(2/20/07) - make laser power slider range be 0-1000 mW
(2/20/07) - make LaserControlPanel observer of Laser
(2/20/07) - layout LaserControlPanel using Piccolo instead of JPanel
(2/20/07) - set layout of laser objective, incoming beam, control panel
(2/20/07) - fix initial positioning of Laser and Bead views
(2/20/07) - make view nodes observers of their model elements
(2/20/07) - remove glass slide from model, fluid model is sufficient
(2/20/07) - change "flow velocity" to "flow speed" through, there is no direction control
(2/14/07) - dynamically resize width of glass slide view to match play area width
(2/14/07) - continue work on Laser view (objective, incoming beam, etc)
(2/14/07) - use model to size/position view nodes
(2/14/07) - create model-view transform for mapping between coordinate systems
(2/14/07) - flesh out bits of model related to controls, positioning, sizing, etc.
(2/6/07) - add warning sign to laser control panel
(2/6/07) - toggle laser start/stop button
(2/6/07) - settable font for LaserControlPanel
(2/6/07) - define separate fonts in OTConstants for controls in control panel and play area
(2/6/07) - first pass at Laser control panel
(2/6/07) - fluid control panel
(2/6/07) - add ad hoc view of bead (no connection to model, no drag constraints)
(2/6/07) - add ad hoc view of glass slide (no connection to model)
(2/5/07) - implement "reset all" for first module
(2/5/07) - wire up first control panel to show/hide controls properly
(2/5/07) - create a separate "default values" class for each module
(2/5/07) - add all Swing components to first control panel, no wiring
(2/5/07) - add entries in CVS modules and loginfo
(2/5/07) - sim requires charts, add dependencies on jfreechart and jfreechart-phet
(2/5/07) - remove speed slider from clock control panel
(1/29/07) - set up ProGuard
(1/29/07) - set up dev directory
(1/29/07) - create JNLP files
(1/29/07) - set up basic application framework (modules, control panels, clock controls, persistence, etc)
(1/29/07) - set up project in CVS

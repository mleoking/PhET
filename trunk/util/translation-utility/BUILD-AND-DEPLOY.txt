Until an automated build-and-deploy task is added to build.xml, this file documents the manual process.

Follow these steps to build & deploy:

1. make sure that all changes are tested and checked in

2. set the version properties in data/translation-utility/translation-utility.properties,
   document the version number in CHANGES.txt,
   then check in both translation-utility.properties and CHANGES.txt

3. ant build-jar

4. scp deploy/translation-utility.jar tigercat:/web/htdocs/phet/phet-dist/translation-utility/

5. scp data/translation-utility/translation-utility.properties tigercat:/web/htdocs/phet/phet-dist/translation-utility/

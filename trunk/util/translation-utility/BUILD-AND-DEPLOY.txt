Until an automated build-and-deploy task is added to build.xml, this file documents the manual process.

Follow these steps to build & deploy:

1. make sure that all changes are tested and checked in

2. set the version properties in data/translation-utility/translation-utility.properties,
   document the version number in CHANGES.txt,
   write release notes in deploy/HEADER,
   then check in translation-utility.properties, CHANGES.txt, and HEADER

3. run build-and-deploy-dev or build-and-deploy-prod build target

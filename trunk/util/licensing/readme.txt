This program is a multimedia browser for phet applications.
The purposes is to be able to view and annotate images and sound used in phet simulations for purposes of copyright and licensing.

To start, set the TRUNK_PATH in Config, then launch edu.colorado.phet.licensing.DisplayDependenciesHTML (I think your working directory must be set to simulations-java).

Let me know if you have questions or comments.

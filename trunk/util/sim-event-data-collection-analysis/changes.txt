Fixed: Null pointer checks on server database monitor
Fixed: Pressing reset all should not count as a solution transition
Fixed: The total number of clicks and the sum of the clicks per min should be equal in the histogram

Added a legend
Show tooltips on camera so they don't scale with zoom level
Added tooltips for specific events
Made yellow (system) events wider and always behind black (user) events
Added plots for events and unique events
Show tick label above the tick lines
In PlotStudentActivity, instead of long timestamp, just show 0:00, then 10:00 then 20:00
In PlotStudentActivity instead of machine ID, show "Student "+id
# 00.00.06 (58801) Nov 28, 2011

Add special handling of different leave types: sick-leave, vacation-leave, paid-vacation
    These should just be entered manually as time entries, but (unlike other entry types)
    it's okay for them to overlap with work times.  These categories can be treated differently in reports,
    but handling them explicitly in the timesheet may simplify organization (instead of tracking these in a different way/place).
In reporting, assume empty notes means same task as previous non-empty notes in same category

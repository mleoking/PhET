1. Overview
   --------
   JIntellitype is an API for interacting with Microsoft Intellitype keyboard
   commands as well as registering for Global Hotkeys in your application.  
   The API is a Java JNI library that uses a DLL to do all the communication
   with Windows.   This library ONLY works on Windows.
   
   Have you ever wanted to have CTRL+SHIFT+G maximize your Swing application 
   on the desktop even if that application did not have focus?  Now you can by
   registering a Windows Hotkey combination your application will be alerted 
   when the combination you select is pressed anywhere in Windows.
   
   Have you ever wanted to react to those special Play, Pause, Stop keys on some
   Microsoft and Logitech keyboards?  Even some laptops now have those special
   keys built in and if you want your application to "listen" for them, now you
   can! 
   
	
2. Features
   --------
   -> Can register global hotkey combinations in Windows 
   -> Application is notified even if it does not have focus.
   -> Can react to those Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Forward Media keys like Winamp
   -> Very little code, easy to use API
   -> Examples included in JIntellitypeTester.java

3. Installation
   ------------
   
   FOR USERS:
   -> Copy the following files into your classpath 
        -> jintellitype.jar
        -> JIntellitype.dll (or put in Windows/System32)
		-> JIntellitype64.dll (rename to JIntellitype.dll and put in path)
        
   FOR DEVELOPERS:
   -> To build you need Maven 2.0.7 or higher installed from Apache.  Just run "mvn package" from the
      directory where the pom.xml is located to build the project.

   -> To build the C++ code you need Bloodshed C++ IDE.  When you load the .dev project included do not
      forget to edit Project->Options and under Directories Tab change the Includes directory to contain 
	  both:
	      /java5/include
		  /java5/include/win32
		  
      Where "java5" is the location of your Java JDK.
	  

4. Quick Usage
   ------------

// Create JIntellitype
	...
        JIntellitype.getInstance().addHotKeyListener(new HotKeyListener() {...);
        JIntellitype.getInstance().addIntellitypeListener(new IntellitypeListener() {...);
	...

// Assign global hotkeys to Windows+A and ALT+SHIFT+B
        JIntellitype.getInstance().registerHotKey(1, JIntellitype.MOD_WIN, (int)'A');
        JIntellitype.getInstance().registerHotKey(2, JIntellitype.MOD_ALT + JIntellitype.MOD_SHIFT, (int)'B');
        
// listen for hotkey
        public void onHotKey(int aIdentifier) {
           if (aIdentifier == 1)
             System.out.println("WINDOWS+A hotkey pressed");
           }
        }
        
// listen for intellitype play/pause command
        public void onIntellitype(int aCommand) {
           switch (aCommand) {
		case JIntellitype.APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE:
			System.out.println("Play/Pause message received " + Integer.toString(aCommand));
			break;
		default:
			System.out.println("Undefined INTELLITYPE message caught " + Integer.toString(aCommand));
			break;
		}
        }

// Termination
	...
	JIntellitype.getInstance().cleanUp();
	System.exit(0);

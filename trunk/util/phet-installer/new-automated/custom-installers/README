This directory contains the scripts necessary for a specialized installer
created for KSU.  The scripts and other files included here are essentially
copies of the files that are used by the standard installer builder, with
modifications made to support KSU's particular requirements.  A decision was
made not to try to generalize the existing installer builder in order to
meet KSU's needs, at least not at this time.  At some point, if another 
university needs this kind of a specailized and translated installer, it
would probably make sense to go ahead and generalize the installer builder to
handle all such cases.

The basic approach for this effort was to copy only the needed files from the
main installer-builder directory, modify them only as much as needed to get
the job done, and to leave the major tools (i.e. HTTrack and BitRock) in the
main intaller builder directory and point to them from here (so as not to
duplicate them).

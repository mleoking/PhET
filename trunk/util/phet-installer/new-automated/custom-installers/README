This directory contains scripts for creating custom installer, meaning
installers that are created specifically for some end user other than PhET.
At the time of this writing, there are two such installers, one for KSU and
one for Young and Freedman.

The scripts and other files included here are essentially copies of the files
that are used by the standard installer builder, with modifications made to
support the particular requirements.  A decision was made not to try to
generalize the existing installer builder, at least not at this time.  At
some point, if another customer needs this kind of a specailized and
customized installer, it would probably make sense to go ahead and generalize
the installer builder to handle all such cases.  In our discussions so far,
this probably means rewriting it in Java.

The basic approach for this effort was to copy only the needed files from the
main installer-builder directory, modify them only as much as needed to get
the job done, and to leave the major tools (i.e. HTTrack and BitRock) in the
main intaller builder directory and point to them from here (so as not to
duplicate them).

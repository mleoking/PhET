This directory contains the scripts necessary for a specialized installer
builder created for Young and Freedman.  This version of the installer builder
was needed after the KSU installer builder was created, but was very similar,
so the KSU installer builder was used as the starting point (as opposed to
the primary installer builder).

This is ugly in the sense that it is resulting in a lot of duplicated code,
but that is the direction that we are being given due to the high cost of
cleaning up all of this code, or doing a full rewrite in Java.  The Java
rewrite is being planned for some point in the future.

As with the KSU installer builder, the major tools (i.e. HTTrack and BitRock)
that are used in the course of create the installers will exist only in the
main intaller builder directory, and the scripts in this directory will point
to them from here (so as not to duplicate them).

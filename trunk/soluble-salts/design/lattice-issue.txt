Lattice Issue
-------------
Copper hydroxide doesn't build properly, and the problem has to do with the way orientation is used in
the building process.

The orientation that is used to figure out where the open sites are is the orientation of the
whole crystal. With the 2:1 lattice, this is a problem, because the 2 ions always bond in the direction
of the crystal's orientation, or 180 degrees opposite. Half the 2 ions, however, should bond along
lines at 90 degrees to those orientations.

When a hydroxide (the 1 ion) bonds, it creates a free site that is oriented 180 degrees from the the ion that
the hydroxide bonded to. That orientation is the one that a copper ion (the 2 ion) needs to use when it
bonds to the hydroxide, not the orientation of the crystal.

The crystal determine the proper orientation for the ion to use when it looks for the right place in the
lattice to bind.

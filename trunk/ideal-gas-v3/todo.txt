- Performance now SUCKS!!!!!

- Add gravity controls to measurement panel

- Mannequin needs to be lower on the screen.
- Box leaves screen turds when you move the wall.

- Sam, clockStateListeners

- Fix up collisions with sphere. Can we get rid of constraints?

- Make the stove a model element and move IdealGasModel.addHeatFromStove() to Stove.stepInTime()

- Combine collision detectors and collision classes into common collision experts
- Add collision detectors and collisions for the hollow sphere classes

- check CollidableBody.stepInTimeNoNotify()

- pressure slice graphic overlays mannequin

- scalarDataRecorder should be re-written so it doesn't need a clock, but rather observes an ScalarReporter

- clean up constraints. In particular, there is a lot of duplication in HollowSphereMustContain and
HollowSphereMustNotContain

- hierarchy of Body/.../IdealGasParticle is way too big. Clean it up!

- Gravity: there is a lot of code in the model that refers to a gravity object, but all the
manipulation of gravity is currently done in the module, and that object only appears in the
model as a modelElement

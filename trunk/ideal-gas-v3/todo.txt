- make more versatile & robust collision detection system that works heirarchically with object types
- when hot air balloon is putting in heat, the whole system heats up, but only when gravity is on
- each time you pump the handle the temperature goes up
- Combine Rigid Sphere modules
- Sort CollisionExperts in to the list by their type specificity
- Add gravity controls to measurement panel
- Sam, clockStateListeners
- Fix up collisions with sphere. Can we get rid of constraints?
- Make the stove a model element and move IdealGasModel.addHeatFromStove() to Stove.stepInTime()
- check CollidableBody.stepInTimeNoNotify()
- pressure slice graphic overlays mannequin
- scalarDataRecorder should be re-written so it doesn't need a clock, but rather observes an ScalarReporter
- clean up constraints. In particular, there is a lot of duplication in HollowSphereMustContain and
HollowSphereMustNotContain
- hierarchy of Body/.../IdealGasParticle is way too big. Clean it up!

- put digital readouts on thermometer and pressure gauge. Tick marks on thermometer
- Put pump, box and mannequin on common baseline
- consolidate MoleculePanel classes in RigidHollowSphere and HeliumBalloon
- set default energy so kinetic energy is never < 0
- average speed doesn't report properly
- make more versatile & robust collision detection system that works heirarchically with object types
- when hot air balloon is putting in heat, the whole system heats up, but only when gravity is on
- rename and consolidate collision expert/detector classes
- Sam, clockStateListeners
- Fix up collisions with sphere. Can we get rid of constraints?
- Make the stove a model element and move IdealGasModel.addHeatFromStove() to Stove.stepInTime()
- check CollidableBody.stepInTimeNoNotify()
- pressure slice graphic overlays mannequin
- scalarDataRecorder should be re-written so it doesn't need a clock, but rather observes an ScalarReporter
- clean up constraints. In particular, there is a lot of duplication in HollowSphereMustContain and
HollowSphereMustNotContain
- hierarchy of Body/.../IdealGasParticle is way too big. Clean it up!

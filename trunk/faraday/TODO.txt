"To Do" list for "faraday" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- compute emf by averaging emf at center and 2 edges of coil
- optimize grid when background is black or white (don't use alpha)
- fast movement of magnet is not shown by lightbulb or voltmeter
- add Verlet behavior to voltmeter needle 
- make lightbulb ramp up/down instead of immediate on/off
- show important "spikes" in induced emf (consider totally disabling smoothing)
- collision detection between compass and magnet
- collision detection between magnet and coil
- transparent bar magnet layer so that field meter looks like it's inside it
- animate electrons when lightbulb is enabled (front of coil only)
- performance optimizations

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- beautify Control Panels
- Transformer module requirements
- check for unnecessary notification, events and updates


LOW PRIORITY:
- agree on control labels
- Wiggle Me's
- remove unused images from JAR file
- remove unused i18n strings
- Help/MegaHelp
- resize any images that are currently scaled (eg, bar magnet)

phetcommon:
- MathUtil.clamp behavior with Double.NaN
- add setComposite to PhetGraphic and its subclasses, use in BarMagnetGraphic

DONE:
v0r11...
(2/3) - merge HollywoodCompass into Compass, collapse AbstractCompass and Compass
v0r10...
(2/2) - redo lightbulb graphic, looks ratty on black background
(2/2) - fix CoilGraphic so that it's foreground & background look right when magnet passes thru coil near edges
(2/1) - add threshold to Compass.stepInTime to prevent Verlet from hogging CPU
(2/1) - redo coil graphic (constant wire gauge, fix colors)
v0r9...
(1/28) - pull "developer" panel out of BarMagnetControlPanel so that it can be reused elsewhere
(1/28) - grid is not always full of needles (GraphicLayerSet fix)
(1/28) - bounds of light rays are not always correct (GraphicLayerSet fix)
(1/28) - rewrite CompassGraphic to use Shapes instead of image
v0r8...
(1/27) - add color chooser so that folks can experiment with apparatus panel colors
(1/27) - let control panels manipulate model/view components directly instead of via module
(1/27) - one debug control for "Grid spacing" (instead of separate controls for XY spacing)
(1/27) - "probe" to "meter" throughout code
(1/27) - B Field Meter coordinate system: +X right, +Y up, +angle counterclockwise (0 degrees down +X axis)
(1/27) - redo B Field Meter graphic (30% larger fonts, "Magnetic (B) Field" title, i18n)
(1/27) - use compass needle aspect ratio for grid needles
v0r7...
(1/26) - adjust sensitivity of voltmeter and lightbulb
(1/26) - factor out common code for value rescaling
(1/26) - add value rescaling to lightbulb & voltmeter
(1/25) - use median values always, except when changing polarity, #loops or radius
(1/25) - compass on/off control
(1/25) - reduce range of magnet strength to 100-300 Gs
(1/25) - move median filtering into PickupCoil (emf)
(1/25) - use one image for bar magnet, set transparency using g2.setComposite
(1/24) - use CCK graphic for lightbulb illumination
(1/24) - use median values only when magnet or coil are being dragged
(1/21) - separate PickupCoilGraphic into foreground & background layers
(1/21) - rescale alpha values in compass grid to account for magnet strength and field dropoff
(1/21) - redo BFieldProbe graphic, add crosshairs
(1/21) - redo voltmeter graphic, add "volts" label
v0r6...
(1/20) - when flipping polarity, jiggle the compass so that it starts moving sooner
(1/20) - control to turn BFieldProbe on/off
(1/20) - "see inside magnet" feature
(1/20) - no change in EMF when point moves around inside magnet (THIS IS CORRECT! Mike)
(1/20) - rename module Compass Grid -> Bar Magnet
(1/20) - rename module Bar Magnet -> Magnet & Coil
(1/20) - redo compass graphic
(1/20) - use Ron's enhancements to ControlPanel
v0r5...
(1/19) - sample graphic for electron "look"
(1/19) - draw pickup coil correctly when loop area is changed
(1/19) - redo coil graphic, more of a tilt, thicker wire, copper/brown color
(1/18) - averaging of values so that lightbulb & voltmeter behave smoothly
(1/18) - determine the role of "current" in the model
(1/14) - fix PickupCoil.stepInTime to properly set EMF and induced current
(1/14) - model elements for lightbulb and voltmeter
(1/13) - add inertia to compass needle
v0r4...
(1/12) - dipole stuff is screwed up when magnet polarity is flipped
(1/11) - add B-field probe
(1/6) - nail down semantics of magnet "strength"
(1/5) - equation for the magnetic field of a dipole
v0r3...
(1/4) - how to populate resized apparatus panel with grid?
(1/3) - compass
(1/3) - wires connecting loop to meter/bulb
(1/3) - alpha channel in lightbulb emission
(12/28) - change "loop area" control to be value-based, not scale-based

NO:
(1/28) - use offscreen buffering in apparatus panel to remove screen turds? (found GraphicLayerSet problem)

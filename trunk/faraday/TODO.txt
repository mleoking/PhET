"To Do" list for "faraday" simulation

IN PROGRESS:
- determine how to make compass grid use field vector magnitude

HIGH:
- determine the role of "current" in the model
- add inertia to voltmeter needle
- averaging of values so that lightbulb & voltmeter behave smoothly
- how to separate PhetCoilGraphic into foreground & background layers
- redo coil graphic, more of a tilt, thicker wire, copper/brown color
- draw pickup coil correctly when loop area is changed
- calibration of everything so that sensitivity can be adjusted
- show electrons flowing (blue) when lightbulb is enabled

MEDIUM:
- lightbulb emission graphic (same as CCK?)
- collision avoidance (which objects?)
- use Ron's enhancements to ControlPanel
- Transformer module requirements

LOW:
- Wiggle Me's
- Help/MegaHelp
- correct lighting on flipped bar magnet

DONE:
(1/14) - fix PickupCoil.stepInTime to properly set EMF and induced current
(1/14) - model elements for lightbulb and voltmeter
(1/13) - add inertia to compass needle
(1/12) - dipole stuff is screwed up when magnet polarity is flipped
(1/11) - add B-field probe
(1/6) - nail down semantics of magnet "strength"
(1/5) - equation for the magnetic field of a dipole
(1/4) - how to populate resized apparatus panel with grid?
(1/3) - compass
(1/3) - wires connecting loop to meter/bulb
(1/3) - alpha channel in lightbulb emission
(12/28) - change "loop area" control to be value-based, not scale-based

"To Do" list for "faraday" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- Lightbulb & Voltmeter beat with a false peak, especially visible with AC electromagnet (100% amp, 33% freq)

HIGH PRIORITY:
- trace/scan the AC wave with a cursor that represents "now"
- add playback controls to relevant modules (override Module.activate/deactivate)
- label current source choices "DC" and "AC"
- add a water wheel graphic to turbine, paddles as wide as widest water stream
- RPM readout on turbine (at center of rotation?)
- tick marks around voltmeter display
- handle for faucet that looks like the side view of a faucet handle, put slider inside handle
- requirements for Generator module
- calibrate lightbulb
- calibrate voltmeter
- calibrate electron speed in pickup coil
- disable lightbulb/voltmeter/electron rescaling so that their response is proportional to magnet strength

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- redo Turbine model, it should not extend BarMagnet (it has a BarMagnetPanel)
- lightbulb flashes the first time that you visit each module
- sliders sometimes remain hilited after you roll off them
- electrons appear to flow faster in a coil with fewer loops with the same voltage (frame rate issue)
- relocate voltage rescaling from Voltmeter model to Voltmeter view, so that all rescaling is done in the view
- when a drag collision occurs, don't ignore the translate, move the object as close as possible
- Wiggle Me's on magnets & coil

LOW PRIORITY:
- generalize BarMagnetGraphic.InteractivityListener into some type of delegate/decorator
- check for unnecessary notification, events and updates
- replace EasyGridBagLayout with SwingUtils.addGridBagComponent
- background color (use new PhetApplication interface)
- transparent bar magnet layer so that field meter looks like it's inside it
- Help/MegaHelp
- resize any images that are currently scaled (eg, bar magnet, electron)

CLEANUP:
- remove unused images from JAR file
- remove unused i18n strings
- delete DeveloperPanel when no longer needed
- delete BatteryPanel and ACPanel when no longer needed
- remove DebuggerGraphic from modules
- move test-src programs to examples project

POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- use a profiler (eg JProfile) to identify bottlenecks
- draw grid needles as images instead of shapes
- cache grid needles at N-degree angles to eliminate rotation transform
- eliminate AffineTransform from BarMagnet.getStrength(Point2D) and PickupCoil.updateEmf

PHETCOMMON:
- bug: hand cursor accidentally picks another object when you release mouse
- bug: ApparatusPanel2 resize problems
- bug: MathUtil.clamp behavior with Double.NaN
- add setComposite to PhetGraphic and its subclasses, use in BarMagnetGraphic
- bug: fix PhetShapeGraphic.contains so that stroke width is taken into account, test with CompassGraphic
- make PhetTextGraphic handle <br>, deprecate PhetMultiLineTextGraphic
- bug: ApplicationModel shouldn't require you to call setInitialModule, should default to first module provided

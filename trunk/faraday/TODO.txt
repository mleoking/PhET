HIGH:
(DONE) - change "loop area" control to be value-based, not scale-based
- nail down semantics of magnet "strength"
- calibration of everything so that sensitivity can be adjusted
- equation for the magnetic field of a dipole
(NO) B-field lines
- compass
- good graphic for loop
- show electrons flowing
- wires connecting loop to meter/bulb
- alpha channel in lightbulb emission
- how to populate resized apparatus panel with grid?

MEDIUM:
- collision avoidance
- correct lighting on flipped bar magnet
- ControlPanel base class that handles layout
- Transformer module

LOW:
- Wiggle Me's
- Help/MegaHelp

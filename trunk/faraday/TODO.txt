"To Do" list for "faraday" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:
- adjust sensitivity of voltmeter and lightbulb

HIGH PRIORITY:
- collision detection between compass and magnet
- bounds of light rays are not always correct (doesn't fully draw or doesn't fully erase)
- redo coil graphic (constant wire gauge, fix colors)
- show electrons flowing (blue) when lightbulb is enabled, keep constant size
- collision detection between magnet and coil

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- beautify Control Panels
- add inertia to voltmeter needle?
- Transformer module requirements
- B Field Meter coordinate system (+Y down?)

LOW PRIORITY:
- rewrite CompassGraphic to use Shapes instead of image
- agree on control labels
- Wiggle Me's
- remove unused images from JAR file
- Help/MegaHelp
- correct lighting on flipped bar magnet

phetcommon:
- MathUtil.clamp behavior with Double.NaN

DONE:
(1/26) - factor out common code for value rescaling
(1/26) - add value rescaling to lightbulb & voltmeter
(1/25) - use median values always, except when changing polarity, #loops or radius
(1/25) - compass on/off control
(1/25) - reduce range of magnet strength to 100-300 Gs
(1/25) - move median filtering into PickupCoil (emf)
(1/25) - use one image for bar magnet, set transparency using g2.setComposite
(1/24) - use CCK graphic for lightbulb illumination
(1/24) - use median values only when magnet or coil are being dragged
(1/21) - separate PickupCoilGraphic into foreground & background layers
(1/21) - rescale alpha values in compass grid to account for magnet strength and field dropoff
(1/21) - redo BFieldProbe graphic, add crosshairs
(1/21) - redo voltmeter graphic, add "volts" label
(1/20) - when flipping polarity, jiggle the compass so that it starts moving sooner
(1/20) - control to turn BFieldProbe on/off
(1/20) - "see inside magnet" feature
(1/20) - no change in EMF when point moves around inside magnet (THIS IS CORRECT! Mike)
(1/20) - rename module Compass Grid -> Bar Magnet
(1/20) - rename module Bar Magnet -> Magnet & Coil
(1/20) - redo compass graphic
(1/20) - use Ron's enhancements to ControlPanel
(1/19) - sample graphic for electron "look"
(1/19) - draw pickup coil correctly when loop area is changed
(1/19) - redo coil graphic, more of a tilt, thicker wire, copper/brown color
(1/18) - averaging of values so that lightbulb & voltmeter behave smoothly
(1/18) - determine the role of "current" in the model
(1/14) - fix PickupCoil.stepInTime to properly set EMF and induced current
(1/14) - model elements for lightbulb and voltmeter
(1/13) - add inertia to compass needle
(1/12) - dipole stuff is screwed up when magnet polarity is flipped
(1/11) - add B-field probe
(1/6) - nail down semantics of magnet "strength"
(1/5) - equation for the magnetic field of a dipole
(1/4) - how to populate resized apparatus panel with grid?
(1/3) - compass
(1/3) - wires connecting loop to meter/bulb
(1/3) - alpha channel in lightbulb emission
(12/28) - change "loop area" control to be value-based, not scale-based

NO:

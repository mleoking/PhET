===============================================================================
"To Do" list for "faraday" simulation
===============================================================================

IN PROGRESS:


HIGH PRIORITY:
- bug report: direction of electron movement is wrong in pickup coil for "Pickup Coil" and "Transformer" modules, 
  OK in "Generator"; foreground electrons should move down as flux increases. Problem in "Transformer" module
  only when battery voltage is negative.
 
MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- bug: physics is incorrect for transformer (voltage in the secondary circuit should be proportional to the ratio of
the number of loops in the secondary to the number in the primary)

LOW PRIORITY:
- when a drag collision occurs, don't ignore the translate, move the object as close as possible
- Help/MegaHelp

(1/19) - redo coil graphic, more of a tilt, thicker wire, copper/brown color
(1/18) - averaging of values so that lightbulb & voltmeter behave smoothly
(1/18) - determine the role of "current" in the model
(1/14) - fix PickupCoil.stepInTime to properly set EMF and induced current
(1/14) - model elements for lightbulb and voltmeter
(1/13) - add inertia to compass needle
v0r4...
(1/12) - dipole stuff is screwed up when magnet polarity is flipped
(1/11) - add B-field probe
(1/6) - nail down semantics of magnet "strength"
(1/5) - equation for the magnetic field of a dipole
v0r3...
(1/4) - how to populate resized apparatus panel with grid?
(1/3) - compass
(1/3) - wires connecting loop to meter/bulb
(1/3) - alpha channel in lightbulb emission
2005 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(12/28) - change "loop area" control to be value-based, not scale-based
2004 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NO:
(?) - add a graph of field strength over time to the Field Meter (unnecessary)
(4/25) - use offscreen buffering (no improvement)
(4/25) - disable rectangle computations and use paintImmediately (no improvement)
(4/24) - use a variable-step clock with median filtering of dt (lightbulb & voltmeter don't look cyclic, they jump around)
(4/24) - optimize electrons (their performance hit is negligible compared to grid)
(4/24) - calculate periods of Generator and AC so that delta flux is zero/max at correct point (no, handle this in Lightbulb)
(4/22) - simplified expressions in DipoleMagnet.getStrengthInside (already optimal, no trig functions)
(4/22) - get rid of the amplitude stuff in AbstractVoltageSource and AbstractCoil (document it clearly)
(4/19) - glitch in the B-field when approaching the electromagnet coil from above or below (this is physically correct)
(4/12) - replace EasyGridBagLayout with SwingUtils.addGridBagComponent (no, SwingUtils version is inadequate)
(4/12) - fix PhetShapeGraphic.contains so that stroke width is taken into account (compass is now flattened to an image)
(4/8) - make wiggle me's fade out instead of blinking off (no one asked for this, different than other sims)
(4/6) - put compass in top layer so it doesn't get hidden behind larger objects (compass needs to move through coil)
(4/5) - lightbulb flashes the first time that you visit each module (Carl likes this, leave it in)
(4/4) - eliminate AffineTransform from BarMagnet.getStrength(Point2D) and PickupCoil.updateEmf (not possible)
(4/4) - add scaling of pixel-space (not necessary, but would be done in DipoleMagnet.getStrengthInside)
(3/29) - draw needles using Graphics.fillPolygon (no performance improvement)
(3/29) - transparent bar magnet layer so that field meter looks like it's inside it (no one except Ron asked for this feature)
(3/29) - redo Turbine model, it should not extend BarMagnet (fine as is for this simulation)
(3/24) - cache grid needles at N-degree angles to eliminate rotation transform (rotation is not the problem, fill is the problem)
(3/24) - draw grid needles as images instead of shapes (no improvement using images)
(3/24) - explicitly set the initial capacity (# coordinates) in the compass needle paths (no performance improvement)
(3/24) - explicitly set the winding rule for the compass needle paths (no performance improvement)
(3/23) - draw the needles into a buffered image, then blit it to the screen (slower)
(3/23) - flatten static components of TurbineGraphic (water needs to be between wheel and magnet)
(3/17) - add playback controls to relevant modules (code & semantics do not support this on a per-Module basis)
(3/16) - collision detection in Generator & Transformer modules (fine as is)
(2/23) - handle rescaling in VoltmeterGraphic instead of in Voltmeter model (rotational kinematics of needle requires rescaling)
(2/17) - disable "See Inside Magnet" control when grid is off (control was removed)
(2/17) - change sliders to "ModelSlider" used by other simulations (No - not used by many others, has problems)
(2/15) - encapulate all rescaling of emf into one place (already encapsulated in Rescaler)
(2/10) - PickupCoilGraphic leaves screen turds (ApparatusPanel2 problem)
(2/10) - make lightbulb ramp up/down instead of immediate on/off (looks fine as is)
(2/7) - repaint compass grid when background color changes, in case we're switching rendering strategies (no longer necessary)
(1/28) - use offscreen buffering in apparatus panel to remove screen turds? (found GraphicLayerSet problem)

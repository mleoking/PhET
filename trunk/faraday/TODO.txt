"To Do" list for "faraday" simulation

HIGH:
- equation for the magnetic field of a dipole
- averaging of values so that lightbulb & voltmeter behave smoothly
- redo coil graphic, more of a tilt, thicker wire, copper/brown color
- draw pickup coil correctly when loop area is changed
- how to separate PhetCoilGraphic into foreground & background layers
- add inertia to compass needle
- add inertia to voltmeter needle
(DONE) - change "loop area" control to be value-based, not scale-based
- nail down semantics of magnet "strength"
- calibration of everything so that sensitivity can be adjusted
(NO) B-field lines
(DONE) - compass
- show electrons flowing (blue)
(DONE) - wires connecting loop to meter/bulb
(DONE) - alpha channel in lightbulb emission
(DONE) - how to populate resized apparatus panel with grid?

MEDIUM:
- lightbulb emission graphic (same as CCK?)
- collision avoidance (which objects?)
- ControlPanel base class that handles layout
- Transformer module requirements

LOW:
- Wiggle Me's
- Help/MegaHelp
- correct lighting on flipped bar magnet

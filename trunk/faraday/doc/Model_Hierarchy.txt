Faraday's Law - Model Heirarchy

Below is the type hierarchy of the Faraday simulation model (edu.colorado.phet.faraday.model).
Classes that implement ModelElement are marked with a '*'; they contain one or more attributes that vary over time. 
Also indicated are the Observer-Observable relationships.

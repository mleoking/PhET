Build scripts are not fixed for this 2nd draft feasibility test yet.

Beware of the 256 max filename size in windows.

Test on a 10.3.9 mac.

Original problems (with full-blown netx implementation)
O security
O running multiple apps in the same JVM or alternatively, launching a separate jvm
O permissions
O running this launcher as signed webstart vs un-sandboxed app
O downloading and versioning multiple resources per jnlp
O testing this code on multiple platforms
O difficulty of testing this code (could be robustly overcome, but would take time).
O downloading thumbnails for images, storing them locally (so low bandwidth), but updating them when possible.
O storing a master list of available applications, which can be downloaded when available.

Remaining problems:
O security for host app (don't want to accidentally delete things)
O testing this code on multiple platforms
O difficulty of testing this code (could be robustly overcome, but would take time).
O storing a master list of available applications, which can be downloaded when available.

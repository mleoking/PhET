- still slow on MRI module

========
Features
========
- Get rid of classes that supported the big blue arrow in the control panel
- Rename BFieldIndicatorB
Need equivalent of NMR energy levels panel for MRI panel
put range check on the magnetic field text field


=================
0.01.19
=================

- Use standard issue wiggle-me
- Fix offset at bottom of frame for JWS
- remove .0 on slider tracks
- background of text fields with sliders should be white
- More emphatic border around top level controls

=================
0.01.18
=================
Head module doesn't seem to resonate properly across the whole head when
    there is no gradient field
Detector doesn't appear to work at all
Head control panel comes up too wide, and resizes when you move the power slider
Head control panel sub-panels don't line up right
Set fonts for magnet sliders
Make Radiowave Source sliders graphical controls
Vary size and color of donut for different atoms
localize and translate to spanish
wiggle me for frequency and power
- Hide magnetic field arrows
- remove auxiliary squiggle from Head module
- detector doesn't work

==============
0.01.17
==============
Make detector less obtrusive
Make "Hide atoms" "Hide atomic nuclei" (?)
"Hide atoms" checkbox for MRI (or button?)
come up with the field at a reasonable level
Add color picker to Options menu for finding a better background color
Add legend with dipoles and field arrows
Change color of donuts for different atoms
replicate squiggle graphic on Frequency control


Change name on web site to Simplified MRI
Put EMW Rep radio buttons on the Radiowave Source panel
Remove arrows and "I"s from the wires to the coils
Change "Current to Magnet" to "Magnetic Field", and remove reluctance of coil
Move magnet slider down below
Change dipole donut colors on MonitorPanel
Change "Sample material" to "Sample atom"
swap power an frequency controls left and right


0.01.14
-------
Make the area in the control panel that contains the field indicator arrow smaller
Add a "Hide head" check box
Put field arrows across the whole sample area
Change the dipole graphic to be the one suggested by Mike
Reinstate thermal noise
Lower the bottom end of the frequency range to 10MHz
Change the frequecy slider to read out in MHz
Take the "E" off the power slider numbers
Test different materials to see which ones the simulation can make resonate - All materials resonate
Squiggle gets funny below 18MHz
Squiggle doesn't blink anymore

0.01.13
-------
Lengthened period of radio waves to make the simulation easier to look at

0.01.11
---------
Changed the way field strength is represented in the play area in an attempt to better convey how the gradient lies across the sample area.
Change the way noise is injected so that the ratio of spin up to spin down dipoles is as close to the desired ratio as possible at all times.
Field strength should be represented by single line of arrows in all panels.
Change label on field strength indicator in control panel to read "Magnetic Field at Center".
Add sample materials to NMR panel: N, Na, C, O, S, Unkown
Max current to gradient magnets should be 5.
Fewer gradient magnet coils

0.01.10
---------
Thermal noise maintains desired ratio of up to down spins as possible
Thermal noise is now inversely proportional to field magnitude
Fixed 2X problem with field readout
Changed the graphics for the magnets to something I think may work better.
Added a detector. I expect we can do much better than this, however.
Added vertical gradient magnet.

0.01.09
---------
Added thermal noise that flips a random atom at random times.
Protons in tumor respond more to photons. I did this by making these protons (and only these) NOT absorb the photons that hit them
Change numbers in readout for gradient magnet to range from 0 to 2, and have the current representation arrows reflect those numbers. The field produced by the gradient magnet should remain the magnitude it is right now, however.

0.01.08
---------
Changed gradient on magnet so 0 point is at the center. Field is negative to the left of center, and positive to the right.

0.01.06
---------
Fixed performance problem by doing all graphics in screen coordinates and avoiding Piccolo transformations.

0.01.04
---------
Improved probability gradient so that vertical distribution of photons emitted by atoms is more constant
Photons emitted by atoms now make it past the edge of the play area before they're removed

0.01.03
---------
Increase target size of atom
Add atoms in the ears
Make tumor more dense with hydrogen
Make the &quot;Add Tumor&quot; button toggle to &quot;Remove Tumor&quot;
Main magnet should have a minimum current that keeps the arrow in the control panel visible (but small)
Fix sizing of play area so controls are completely visible

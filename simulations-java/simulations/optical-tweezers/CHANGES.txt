REJECTED:
10/29/07 - remove ModelViewTransform to improve performance, handle scaling by setting canvas size (huge increase in memory needed for laser gradient, OutOfMemoryError)
10/10/07 - use phetcommon's Vector2D (my implementation has performance advantages, renamed to OTVector2D)
10/8/07 - improve startup performance (OK as is)
10/8/07 - some Swing controls aren't PropertyChangeListeners for the nodes that they control (ok for now, since they are the only control)
10/1/07 - when subdividing dt in bead motion algorithm, and stepping clock, bead motion will be different than displayed vectors (consequence of using dt subdivision)
10/1/07 - get different values for 2nd enzyme for Kathy's model of DNA speed (not needed, we're using Tom's model)
10/1/07 - should it be possible to drag bead and make DNA strand more straight? (fine as is, with stretchiness=0.95)
9/27/07 - "keep trap force constant" feature slows things down (nothing we can do about this, graphics intensive)
9/27/07 - free end of DNA doesn't evolve when bead is dragged with clock paused (this is OK)
9/26/07 - OutOfMemoryError in Motors module (could not reproduce after 30 minutes)
9/26/07 - reduce laser jitter but using an average for "keep trap force constant" (tried this, no improvement, some new problems)
9/21/07 - make "Return Bead" move the bead to the laser's origin (laser's origin can be off screen)
9/11/07 - save/load properties of position histogram: running, zoom index, ruler (feature not needed)
9/11/07 - vertical laser toggle button, like http://www.bigstockphoto.com/thumbs/6/3/3/medium/336571.jpg (tried to create and failed)
8/20/07 - stall force for enzyme (not needed)
8/15/07 - save/load developer controls (feature not desired)
8/14/07 - use TrigCache to improve performance (performance is OK without it)
8/14/07 - reduce vertical spacing of control panels (not necessary, some controls were dropped)
8/10/07 - enable/disable controls based on clock speed (no longer necessary)
8/10/07 - horizontal trap force features (features dropped)
8/10/07 - hide bead crosshair when showing charge (not necessary)
8/10/07 - click on simulation speed slider track to make knob jump to that position (no one asked for this, nontrivial because it's Piccolo)
8/10/07 - disable "charge on bead" feature in fast mode (looks OK, see what happens in interviews)
8/8/07 - add "charge on bead" features to DNA panel (not part of learning goals for that panel)
7/26/07 - spec for "Show change in momentum model" feature (feature is dropped)
7/25/07 - check _running in Laser.getIntensityOnRadius, getTrapForceAtOffset (no, not the right thing to do)
7/9/07 - histogram should make an observation every N seconds, not every clock tick (every clock tick is correct behavior)
7/9/07 - histogram: ask JFreeChart to put 4 minor ticks between each major tick (JFreeChart does not support minor ticks)
7/2/07 - show DNA strand as a double helix (no one has asked for this)
7/2/07 - DNA strand looks too straight initially, evolve a few times before displaying (no one has noticed this)
7/2/07 - put wheels on laser control panel, make it slide horizontally on train tracks (made entire control panel draggable, added left-right cursor)
6/29/07 - are there any cases where DNA strand's extension length exceeds contour length? (no, not after constraining drag)
6/28/07 - make "beam" the only laser display option in fast mode (better to just let it look like it's running crazy fast)
6/22/07 - show E-field as a blur above some simulation time setting (only show beam view in "fast" mode)
6/21/07 - why don't XY components of Vector2DNode ever have a negative sign? (because Vector2DNode always displays a magnitude)
6/10/07 - instead of scaling termPrevious and termNext, investigate scaling _springConstant in DNAStrand.evolve (doesn't work right)
6/7/07 - get model for Brownian force (delete "Show Brownian force" feature)
6/5/07 - add close button to ruler (inappropriate, ugly, etc)
6/5/07 - why is fluid.getDragForce not used directly in Bead.move (it appears in the model indirectly)
5/31/07 - make DNA tail draggable (feature not needed)
5/17/07 - improve collision detection in Bead.move (not necessary, only Brownian force causes collisions)
4/24/07 - add AbstractValueControl.setInverted (makes things unnecessarily complex)
3/26/07 - change diameter to radius for bead and laser properties (using diameter makes layout clearer)
3/12/07 - generalize LaserPowerControl (probably not generally useful)

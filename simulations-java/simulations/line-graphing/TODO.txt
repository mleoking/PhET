TODO list for line-graphing

DEADLINES

DESIGN
- play area layout feels unbalanced for game challenges
- revisit the placement algorithm for equations on graphed lines
- names for the 3 sims in this project

HIGH
- rewrite demo challenge
- some of the fields and responsibilities in LineGameModel are challenge specific. Eg, mvt, point tools, whether to maintain a list of lines, etc.
- create additional game challenges

MEDIUM
- bug: drag bounds of points tools isn't behaving correctly, should be stage bounds

LOW

DEVELOPER CONTROLS
- replay the current Game challenge
- "resample" to change the challenges for the current Game level
- provide (or specify) a fixed set of challenges for Game testing

GAME CHALLENGES
Do each of these for "Graph the Line" and "Make the Equation"
- slope-intercept form + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + slope variable (plot intercept)
- slope-intercept form + slope variable + intercept variable
- slope-intercept form + 2 point manipulators
- point-slope form + point variable
- point-slope form + slope variable (plot point)
- point-slope form + slope variable + point variable
- point-slope form + 2 point manipulators

DATA COLLECTION
- instrument Game

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- #3423, migrate LGCanvas to common as "StageCanvas", reuse in other sims

Kelly Lancaster's model for the Titration simulation, written in Octave.

Notes about the Octave code:

Ca (and Cb) is the concentration of acid (and base); the range is 0.001 to 1 M.

Va (and Vb) is the volume of acid (and base); when base is the titrant, 
Va is 25 mL and Vb goes from 0 to 75 mL in 0.1 mL increments.  
When acid is the titrant, Vb is 25 mL and Va goes from 0 to 75 mL.  
The only exception is for a triprotic acid, where Vb must go from 0 to 100 mL to see the full curve.

Ka (and Kb) are dissociation constants; the range over which you can 
see a change in the titration curve is 1e0 to 1e-14.  K1, K2 and K3 
are the same constants for diprotic and triprotic acids; they should
really be called Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3.  They have the same range as Ka, 
but K2 must be less than K1, and K3 must be less than K2.

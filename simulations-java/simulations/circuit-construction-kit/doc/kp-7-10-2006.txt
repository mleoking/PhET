Here are some comments:

- Unfortunately performance is an issue ... it's pretty easy to get 
to the point where the mouse isn't working well and it is frustrating 
to build anything... is there any hope of improving this (ever)???

- add (Amps) onto current graph.

- is there any way to make the current graph smoother?  Right now it 
shows features that aren't really there?

- Changing capacitance still doesn't show the right thing ... it 
doesn't show the electrons flowing again to fill up the plate with 
more or less charge.

- If its trivial, please add a play pause step button ... if it's 
not, then add that to the list for the future.

- I ran across a wierd bug, (see attached). I had a nice looking 
circuit and when I was trying to add a bulb to it, it was sort of 
bogging down as I was dragging the bulb, and then all of a sudden it 
collapsed to one line, as shown and totally changed the components in 
the circuit (?). Do you have a short cut of keys that I may have pushed?

- The stop watch needs some beautifying .. right now it has 
programmer names on the buttons.

For future:
- graphs ... would be nice to add dashed grid in background so easier 
to read where you are, also would be nice to have a cursor which 
could move around and scroll along graph, this would require a play, 
pause, step  button to be added in bottom of sim.

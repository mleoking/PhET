REJECTED:
(4/4/06) - top edge of +1 tick label on Energy plot y axis is clipped (problem fixed itself)
(4/4/06) - zoom buttons sometimes aren't drawn or look transparent (problem fixed itself when performance was improved)
(4/4/06) - add a control to vary mass (vetoed by Carl, no pedagogical reason to use anything but constant electron mass)
(3/24/06) - possibly add sum/separate feature for wave packet if we replace Richardson (we're using Richardson, other approaches are worse)
(3/24/06) - try using SwingUtilities.invokeLater on WaveFunctionPlot.update to solve the Swing repaint problem (didn't do anything, not the problem)
(2/22/06) - cache the total energy gradient as an image, update only when necessary (there would be negligible benfit; the times it needs to change are when we're things are sluggish)
(2/22/06) - improve "About" dialog, add build number and logo (phetcommon, no one has asked for this)
(2/22/06) - Y axis labels move when zooming causes range to change (JFreeChart behavior, no one has complained)
(2/20/06) - Wiggle Me (none requested)
(2/20/06 ) - select entire spinner value when it gets focus in Configure dialog (see bugs.sun.com, Bug ID 4699955)
(2/16/06) - disable chart gridlines to improve drag handle responsiveness (no longer an issue, entire chart is an image)
(2/6/06) - restore "phase" veiw state when switching between sum and separate views (confusing)
(2/6/06) - restore sum/separate state when switching between plane and wave packet (confusing)
(1/31/06) - move non-Swing stuff out of event-dispatch thread (lots of work, and doesn't affect performance problems)
(1/25/06) - abandon specialization of CursorHandler to set top-level component cursor, wrong approach
(1/20/06) - try native L&F on all platforms (WindowLookAndFeel looks worse than SmoothMetal for this sim)
(1/20/06) - change time to ns when the time values grows too large to display fs (not worth worrying about)
(1/20/06) - make Configure dialog smarter about enabling Apply button, compare with original model values (not worth it)
(1/19/06) - use XYPlot.zoom* methods for zooming? (we don't have consistent zoom factors)
(1/11/06) - implement Loop button for clock controls (no one asked for this, and it's very hard)
(12/6/05) - will it be possible to drag multiple drag handles at the same time since events aren't marked as handled? (not an issue)
(12/6/05) - how to keep markers behind data (using Layers?) (hasn't been an issue)
(12/3/05) - use JFreeChart legend feature, use setFixedLegendItems to control what's in the legend (my legend is fine)
(11/15/05) - is it OK that barrier width value is not displayed anywhere? (add Configure dialog)
(11/15/05) - do we need to show value as drag handles are moved? (no, add Configure dialog)
(11/15/05) - do we need a way to relocate barriers without moving each edge individually? (yes, in Configure dialog)

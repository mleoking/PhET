The model consists principally of SimpleMolecules and CompositeMolecules, and an EnergyProfile. CompositeMolecules
are composed of SimpleMolecules, only. They cannot contain other CompositeMolecules.
<p/>
There are three types of SimpleMolecules: A, B, and C. A and C molecules can exist either by themselves, or in
combination with one B molecule. CompositeMolecules, therefore can be either AB or BC molecules.
<p>
The EnergyProfile defines the potential energy of an AB molecule, the potential energy of a BC molecule, and
the energy threshold between those two that must be crossed in order for a reaction to occur. The reaction can be
either an A molecule hitting a BC molecule with enough energy to cross the threshold and become an AB molecule
and a free C molecule, or a C molecule hitting an AB molecule resulting in a BC molecule and a free A molecule.
<p>
All collisions are detected and handled by a CollisionAgent.

There are two sorts of bonds in the model. Regular, or "hard" bonds, and provisional bonds. Hard bonds join two
molecules in a compound molecule. Provisional bonds are used to show the relationship between simple molecules that
are within a certain distance of a bonding site in a compound molecule. This includes simple molecules approaching
compound molecules, and simple molecules that are leaving compound molecules after a reaction.

(7-5-2007)
Renamed 3rd tab from "Lasers" to "2 Lasers"
Fixed: For massive particles, the label for “Wave function display” is missing the “y” at the end.
Fixed: part of state cannot be saved/loaded

1.05.01
Removed dependence on OpenSourcePhysics FFT

1.05 (11-8-2006)
Posted on main site.

1.04.01 (11-6-2006)
Bugfix: Hits were not visible in intensity mode.
Bugfix: Electron, Hydrogen and Helium particles rarely detected at screen in Single Particle mode.

1.04 (11-6-2006)
Posted on main site as 1.04

1.03.01 (11-6-2006)
Changed the thresholding mechanism at the screen to avoid some buggy behavior.

1.03 (11-2-2006)
Posted on main site as 1.03

1.02.12 (11-2-2006)
Added wave-reduction code for Single Particle mode, which causes the wavefunction to decay after 200 iterations of propagation.
Bugfix: Detector would crash sometimes (not-a-number value getting to graphics).
Bugfix: Wavefunction was sometimes returning not-a-number for its magnitude.

1.02.11 (11-2-2006)
For Autofire:
            1. Shrink the wave magnitude more aggressively after a sufficiently long time has passed (200 iterations)
            2. After a certain time has passed (400 iterations) simply assume the wave is stuck and fire a new particle.

1.02.10 (11-2-2006)
For Autofire:
            1. Increased threshold below which the magnitude of the wave must fall before another shot is fired.
            2. Added a function that causes the wave magnitude to start shrinking after a sufficiently long time has elapsed.
Removed developer controls.

1.02.09 (11-1-2006)
Changed default screen brightness to 0.75 for single-particle mode.
Set fade to be enabled by default for single-particle mode.

1.02.08 (11-1-2006)
Changed slits representation to ensure symmetry.

1.02.07 (11-1-2006)
Changed default probability threshold for single photon detection to 0.05, and 0.00 for single matter particle detection.
                Removed the "probability threshold" developer control.
Set the default wavelengths to cyan.

Added brightness control to Single Particle Mode.
Added developer control for fade delay for Single Particle Mode.

1.02.05 (10-31-2006)
Changed default probability threshold to 0.04
Made fade dots last 5x as long.
Moved "rapid" checkbox to the clock control panel.
Made probabilty threshold only apply to single-particle-mode.

Added a probability threshold that has to be surpassed before detection is made in Single Particle Module.
Added developer controls (in control panel) for Single Particle Module.
                Rapid button to speed things up a bit.
                Control over probability threshold.

1.02.03 (10-24-2006)
Fixed: The clear button on the screen controls is disabled.  When I looked at this before, I thought it was only disabled in average intensity mode, 
                but now it seems to be disabled all the time.  It shouldn’t be disabled ever.  
                I've noticed repeatedly that this annoys people and they think it's broken, 
                so even if it’s not necessary in average intensity mode, it should still be functional.
Fixed: If I run QWI on auto-repeat for single particles and a double slit for a long time, 
                I would like an interference pattern to build up, but it doesn’t because the dots on the screen fade too fast.  
                The rate of fading should be much slower in single particle mode than in the other two cases, since the dots don’t build up as fast.
Fixed: It would be nice to be have the fade checkbox in single particle mode so that I can turn it off.
                
1.02.02 (10-24-2006)
Fixed: If the simulation is paused and you hit the "Double Slits" button, the slits don't appear until you unpause it.  
                They should appear right away.  Same for disabling the slits.
Fixed: The barriers do appear if you add them when the simulation is paused (as they should), 
                but if you hit "remove all" while it's paused, 
                the outline goes away but the red square is still there.  Everything should go away, even if it's paused.
Fixed: After hitting the "Potential Barriers" button, it says "Hide Potential Barriers".  
                This is confusing because this control doesn't actually hide the potential barriers, 
                just the potential barrier controls.  The word "Hide" should be deleted.
Fixed: The thin blue detector outline on the black background is very hard to see on a projector.  
                The color needs to be lighter and/or the outline thicker.  
                (See the black background color setting in Quantum Tunneling for examples of colors
                that have been found to show up well on black backgrounds on projectors.  
                The blue used here for the imaginary part might be a good option.)
                        Added imaginary color from QT
                        Increased stroke width.
Fixed: Fixed: If I add double slits, and then add a detector on the left slit, 
                without changing anything else first, the detector is shifted to the left, rather than directly over the slit, as it should be.                                                

1.02.01 (10-24-2006)
Added buffering to reduce choppy graphics.
                Maybe this wasn't a problem in webstart version?
                            Could be a java version issue.
                Not 100% certain that the full clip is being drawn. 
Upgraded to latest phetcommon (About Dialog, etc.)
An unexpected change in phetcommon makes the wiggle me come up in a slightly different spot.

1.02.00 (6-28-2006) Posted on main site as 1.02

1.01.06 (6-28-2006)
Removed feature: "Autodetect" has to be deselected before "Repeat Detect" can be checked. 
On the screen brightness slider, removed tick marks 0.25 and 0.75 (incorrect because of rounding off).
Synchronized 2 lasers to center the diffraction pattern and remove beats.
2 Lasers: Moved the rightmost laser slightly to the left to increase symmetry of diffraction patterns.
Detectors can be dragged while the simulation is paused, and the readout updates correctly.
Bugfix: Dragging barriers while paused doesn't paint properly.

1.01.05 (6-27-2006)
Added save/load of double-slits.

1.01.04 (6-27-2006)
2 Lasers Panel:
    Actual wavelength of light should change as you move wavelength slider.
    Two Lasers Panel: Fixed left gun control running off the screen.
    Default configuration should be for the lasers to be different colors, blue and bright red.
Changed format for helium max and min to 0.0 (not 0.000)
Changed “Show Observable” to “Show Expectation Value”
Removed “Print Model Parameter” menu item
Changed “Wave Function Display” to “EM Wave Display” in photon mode.
Removed an error log message (in Java Web Start Console) when there is a detection in single-particle panel.
Changed "one-shot" to “repeat detect”, behaves exactly opposite to “one-shot.”
In High Intensity panel, changed “Advanced” to “Potential Barriers.”
In Single Particles panel, break up “Advanced” into two buttons: “Potential Barriers” and “Detectors”
Slider Scales: Width and Separation – currently min width is 3 pixels and min separation is zero.  Set min width to 4 pixels and min separation to 6 pixels.
Fixed the slit controls so the slit is constrained to be symmetric with respect to slit separation and size.
Bugfix: If you pause the simulation and then press “Clear wave,” you have to step forward before it clears.  It should clear immediately.
Bugfix: If you are stepping through time with detectors and there is a detection, sometimes the detector turns gray and the wave function collapses in the same step, but sometimes the detector turns gray in one step and the wave function collapses in the next step.  It should always behave in the former way.
Bugfix: If ruler is oriented vertically and I resize the simulation, the close and rotate buttons on the ruler move off the ruler.
Bugfix: If I put the ruler too far to the right and make the simulation size smaller, the ruler goes off the screen and I can't get it back without resizing.
Bugfix: When stepping, you have to push step twice for the wavefunction to update once.
"Autodetect" has to be deselected before "Repeat Detect" can be checked.

1.01.03 (6-26-2006)
Fixed factor of 10 problem: for matter waves, ruler units and units per clock tick on stopwatch are 10x bigger.

1.01.02 (6-26-2006)
Changed the velocity slider ranges for particles.

1.01.01 (6-11-2006)
Posted test with decreased min velocity and increased photon wave width.

1.01 Posted on Main Site 6-11-2006

New in 1.00.02
Bugfix: When automatic switching from phase color to magnitude is performed, the radio buttons reflect this change.

New in 1.00.01 (6-5-2006)
Bugfix: For photons in High Intensity panel, turning on detector changes display from time-averaged intensity to E-field.
Bugfix: If you start in E-field view and turn off detector,
    model looks temporarily like time-averaged intensity in upper half of box
    This effect also happens for electrons.
Bugfix: Changing the particle type often messes up the wave function display.
Bugfix: In “hits” mode, the dots appear on the screen in columns, so it appears that there are many very thin interference fringes.
Bugfix: The “one-shot” checkbox doesn’t work.
Bugfix: The detectors don't share probabilities equally.
Bugfix: Text that says “Off” appears next to the left laser in the two lasers panel when maximizing the window.
Bugfix: Putting a detector on the slits,  then turning the gun on causes empty graphics to appear north of the barriers.

New in 1.00 (5-17-2006)
Posted on main site (replaces 0.37)
Changed from alpha to beta.

Reset resets slit width, and slit separation, but does not make the double slits go away.
Bugfix: Adding a barrier in neutron mode no longer crashes the simulation.

New in 0.00.59

Bugfix: startup failed on some machines.
Changed the startup splash window to show progress (part of workaround for the above bugfix)
Removed the help button.
Got rid of propagators control.
Ruler for photons is now 0 to 3000nm instead of 0 to 2700nm
Rotated the vertical ruler so that the bottom is 0 instead of the top.
Moved the ruler to the front (so it's not obscured by the gun or gun controls).
Renamed 'reset all' button to 'reset'.

New in 0.42 (3-2-2006)
Switched detector control from "auto-repeat" to “one shot.”
Reworded “Speeding up time” messages.
Set control panel so that it’s always as wide as it is when “double slits” is open, so that it doesn’t resize when you open it.

Disabled ruler & timer for photon mode.
"nm" on ruler is bigger & bolder

*New in 0.36 (1-30-2006)
Moved Save/Load to the file menu
Barriers & Detectors resize with the grid (although with some roundoff error)

Make the tabs for the different panels larger. (about twice the current size)

*New in 0.35 (1-23-2005)
Added save/load feature for saving barriers/detectors.
The controls look more fun.  (The controls on Ron’s new Photoelectric simulation might be a good model.)
Made gun controls look like the ones in lasers and made sure they don’t overlap with the gun.
Put the intensity and wavelength sliders in a single box to the right of the gun, but attached to the gun like in lasers.

    -when changing visualization style
Add control panel buttons for stopwatch & ruler.
Put the gun type menu in a control box to the left of the gun.
Add a ruler and a clock.  When user changes from electrons to neutrons or helium atoms,
    put an animation of a clock whose hands are slowing down next to actual clock,
    with a bubble that pops up and says “slowing down time.”
    If you go back to electrons, time speeds up and an analogous animation appears.
Bug disappearance: o On mac (or is it just lower resolution?) 2-lasers panel comes up in a weird spot (offset to the left)
Bug disappearance: On mac (or is it just lower resolution?) detector screen is not centered (hits appear above the center)

* New in 0.32 (1-5-2006)

Added units to the simulation (initialization & richardson propagator).
Bugfix: initial wavepackets weren't using hbar
Removed the Custom atom (the one with settable mass)

* New in 0.30 (1-5-2006)
This version uses PSwing in the piccolo project.

* New in 0.29 (1-5-2006)
Corrected phase in Initial wavepackets.
Detectors are now disabled when inverse slits are on.
Moved the "Inverse Barrier" from "Advanced" to "Double Slits"
Renamed the "Inverse Barrier" checkbox to "Anti-slits".
The first detector appears in the center of the box just below the slits.
Added a "Remove All" button for detectors.
Bugfix: With lots of detectors in the single particle panel, I’ve seen it get into a mode where sometimes the wave function would suddenly disappear, but no dot would appear on the screen,and you have to hit the “clear wave button.” / In Single Particle, with a detector on each slit, sometimes both detectors fire simultaneously and the particle disappears.  Hard to reproduce this reliably.
    -Multiple detectors were trying to grab the wavefunction at a single time.
Fixed the range of sliders (for slits) to keep the physics in a meaningful range.
Bugfix: High Intensity mode erroneously displays % values in slit-detectors.

* New in 0.28 (1-4-2005)
Bugfix: resolution changes still crash every now and then.
Bugfix: I managed to get a barrier to jump to a new location and disintegrate, so that the red part of it was gone, and the x on the upper left corner and the green thing on the lower right corner switched places.
Bugfix: Resizing a detector beyond (0,0) has the wrong behavior.
Bugfix: If I add barriers, then add slits, then remove the slits, all the barriers shift out of their boxes.  If I move a barrier after this happens, it snaps back into its box.

* New in 0.26 (1-2-2005) Posted on the main site on 1-4-2006
Removed the 'one-shot' detection button
Bugfix: Sometimes in autofire, the bullets fire quickly from the gun, not having enough time to move more than a few steps across the lattice.
Attached the screen controls to the screen.
Made the top of the left gun narrower so it’s about the same size as the other gun.
Moved the double slit controls to the control panel
Got rid of double slits controls and all the advanced controls on 2-laser
Moved 'clear wave' to the control panel
Change the name of “slit absorption” to “absorbing barriers”
Renamed 'save' to 'copy screen'
When detectors are disabled, the border turns gray and readout disappears.
Removed 'enable all' button (for detectors).
Bugfix: resolution changes are not rescaled.
Bugfix: resolution changes still crash every now and then.

New in 0.25 (12-12-2005):
Increased the barrel size of second gun.

New in 0.24 (12-11-2005):
Added inverse slits feature.  (Babinet's principle is currently not satisfied by this simulation.)
Bugfix: In high intensity with intensity low (and had a detector) the light continued to emenate from the slits (but not the gun)
Slit absorption no longer fails when there is a detector over one of the slits.
Bugfix: the autorepeat on single photon jams with no photons leaving
Bugfix: Detection events no longer fade.
Added absorption & detectors on high-intensity mode
Bugfix: Slit absorption is incompatible with detectors south of the midline.
Change the name of the options menu from "Schrodinger" to "Options".
Bugfix: detectors & barriers only work north of the slits, or if slit absorption is disabled.

New in 0.23 (12-10-2005):
Fixed the dis-play of the two lasers panel so that the controls don't cover 
the lasers.
Fixed the display of two lasers panel so the light actually comes from the lasers.
Set electron mass to 1.0 (unitless, compare to 2.0 and 2.25 for Neutron and Helium).
Made autodetect the default for detectors.
bugfix: detectors become disabled after a successful detection.
Moved barriers & detectors to Advanced panels in control panel.
Increased the size of the Double Slit checkbox, to improve visibility.

New in 0.22 (12-4-2005):
Added neutrons to “gun type” list, change “atoms” to “He atoms”, added custom atoms.
Moved Double-Slit checkbox into the play area, and off the control panel.
The “slit absorption” checkbox, the slit control sliders, and the detector controls, are all be invisible if the double slit is unchecked.
Wave area size is computed based on all controls (to ensure everything fits).
“One-shot” is now one-shot per particle.  Once the particle is detected at the screen, the detector is automatically enabled again.
The “slit absorption” checkbox has been moved to the double slit control area.
Fixed Bug: sometimes when I press “remove all” button, barriers becomes translucent but don’t go away.
Barriers & Detectors appear at random locations (rather than all on top of each other at the same place).
Default slits are wider, so in the default setup, lots more wave reaches the detector.
Fixed Bug: the combo box was mistakenly shown in the Mandel panel.
In two lasers, there are two guns, one the same as in the previous panels, one different.
For electrons and atoms, gun is higher so that particles appear to come from inside the gun, not above it.
When “one-shot” is unchecked, all the disabled detectors are automatically enabled.
One-Shot detection is now disable by default.
Removed the swoop-style wiggle me.
Gray component backgrounds are now light green.
	<Change background color from gray to something more fun (blue background is better, but there’s still too much gray).>
bugfix: ·Application crashes on startup when different region is specified (due to “0,00” parse error.)
The default screen display on high intensity mode is “Average Intensity” not “hits.”
Put “Double slit” checkbox on control panel.
Double slit controls appear near slit if it is enabled.
Bugfix: Double slit detectors should be hidden when barrier is hidden.
Changing slit width no longer changes separation between centers of slits.
Added a corner to barriers and detectors, changed the mouse to double-head arrow.
	<Instead of yellow box to change size of barrier or detector, a small diagonal arrow should appear in the corner, like the arrow that appears to resize things in windows.>

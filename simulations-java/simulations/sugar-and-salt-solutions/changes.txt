Increased font in concentration bar chart readouts
Remove (mol/L) from the title of the concentration box
In the concentration box title, use the same font size as the other box titles
Use the same insets in the collapsed as the expanded bar chart so the +/- button doesn't move around
Moved remove solute buttons to the left side of the beaker
Increased the font for the remove solute buttons
Right aligned all control boxes
Fixed: Reset all button goes offscreen
Reverted to 2L beaker since we do not account for dissolved solute volume
Renamed "Conductivity Tester" to "Conductivity"
# 0.00.26 (52358) May 24, 2011
Made it so water flowing out the drain faucet can conduct

Changed grain sizes to 0.1 gram
# 0.00.16 (52192) May 19, 2011
Removed background from evaporation slider
Use a scaled cartoon size for the grains, since actual grain sizes would be much too large
Salt crystals immediately precipitate when put into an empty beaker, when they hit the bottom or land on other precipitate
Compute sugar and salt grain sizes based on size per solid precipitate
Made sugar and salt grains smaller weight, closer to physical grain sizes
Made the beaker stick up an additional 0.3 cm to accommodate expanded fluid volume due to dissolved solutes, so it won't overflow
Changed from 5g to 1g per grain of salt/sugar
# 0.00.15 (52161) May 18, 2011
Fixed: Underwater light bulb shouldn't light up (shorted out)
Moved "show values" button to a new control panel instead of in the concentration bar chart
Fixed: Crystals sitting on precipitate don’t get dissolved by water when water is added
Fixed: concentration should be moles divided by solution volume, not water volume
Made it so that dissolved solutes take up some volume proportionate to their volume per solid mole
Fixed: salt crystals should land on top of the white rectangle if it exists and there is no water
Fixed: Drain faucet doesn't handle solution properly when precipitate is present
Fixed: too many crystals particles can get added when falling onto the floor of the beaker
Salt particles land on the bottom (no stacking or bumping into each other), then when any water enters the system, go to clump form.
Fixed: If you empty out some solution or remove the solute after you reach the limit, and the salt shaker refills, it adds more salt to the solution on its own.
Limited the amount of water that can be added to the system to be 1.5L
Fixed: the top faucet is not showing a continuous stream of water as you move the slider to the right
Moved the conductivity tester probes down a bit to encourage the user to dip them in the water without dipping the light bulb in the water too
Added credits
Fixed: Can't evaporate all the water
Limited salt and sugar amounts to 500g each
Made salt and sugar grains each mass of 5g
Made salt grains smaller than sugar grains
Started modeling Solution instead of Water
Made the solute appear as a rectangle taking up the full width of the beaker
# 0.00.14 (52087) May 18, 2011
Added collisions between the crystals and the beaker side walls
Made the clump grow faster so it matches with the displaced volume look as a linear function of the L/mole precipitate so sugar grows faster than salt (per mole)
Keep track of how many moles of crystal are in the air, since we need to prevent user from adding more than 10 moles to the system
Fixed: displaced volume isn't used for collision testing
Fixed: incorrect image for sugar dispenser when sugar is depleted
Show empty dispensers when user has already used the max amount of solute
Fixed: When a solute has 10 moles in the system, its dispenser shouldn't emit any more solute
Merged IntroModel with SugarAndSaltSolutionModel
Fixed: Water can overflow the beaker when solutes precipitate and you add water from the top faucet
Fixed: Crystals don't dissolve at the true top of the water (accounting for solid precipitate displacement)
Fixed: Solid precipitate should push up the water level, so that every mole of salt takes up 0.02699 L, and every mole of sugar takes up 0.2157 L
# 0.00.13 (52028) May 17, 2011
Fixed: probes get buried in precipitated clump of salt and can't be retrieved
Fixed: light rays intercept mouse events, making it difficult to use the upper faucet slider
Made so that any part of the conductivity tester probe conducts instead of just the very center of the tip
# 0.00.12 (52008) May 16, 2011
Changed brightness range so that it can accommodate the entire salinity range, up to saturation
Fixed: precipitate dissolves when draining liquid
# 0.00.11 (52005) May 16, 2011
Added saturation and precipitation
Refactored sugar and salt shakers to share the same code
Changed grain amounts to 0.05 mol for salt and 0.01 mol for sugar
Fixed: If you only put a little water (less than the height of the lower pipe) crystals fall past without getting absorbed
# 0.00.10 (51984) May 16, 2011
Fixed: if you press "reset all" when the tester is in the play area, it disappears from the sim
Made it so you can drag the battery to move the conductivity tester
Fixed: if you let go once the electrode is fully immersed, you can't drag it back up (except if you move the bulb)
Made the sugar dispenser more responsive (less lag)
Only show the volume indicator readout when "show values" is selected in the concentration bar chart
Improved location of the "remove salt/sugar" button
Decreased beaker thickness
Only show labels (and tick marks) for 0 L, 1 L, and 2 L, and tick marks for 0.5 L and 1.5 L
Changed each crystal grain from 1E-6 moles to 1E-2 moles
Changed units to mol/L instead of M in concentration bar chart
Made the concentration bar chart visible by default
# 0.00.09 (51947) May 15, 2011
Made it so the sugar dispenser translates when dragged and rotates to pour out sugar to match the user interface of the salt shaker more closely while still allowing both to move about the screen
Show the conductivity tester probes as being submerged underwater
Removed concentration bar chart vertical axis, ticks and labels
Removed evaporation control from "microscopic" tab
Removed conductivity tester from "microscopic" tab
# 0.00.08 (51939) May 15, 2011

Moved conductivity tester tool behind the shakers
Made it so the conductivity tester can be dropped back in the toolbox
Made the bulb draggable
Added a draggable toolbox for the conductivity tester
Hid the red stage outline
Made it so you can’t let all the water flow out through output faucet, only up to faucet level
Fixed: When you let go of the faucet slider, it should snap back (even if the beaker is full or empty)
Fixed: When you let go of the evaporation slider, it should snap back (even if the beaker is empty)
Improved units for concentration value readouts
Show concentration values above the bars in the Concentration bar chart
Added a volume readout for the water
Added +/- buttons to show/hide the concentration bar chart
Made "show values" off by default and resets under "reset all"
Moved "show values" checkbox to the concentration bar chart
Removed "evaporate water" checkbox since the evaporation slider is always shown
Added an evaporation slider to the canvas and wired it up to the model
Fixed: cursor gets away from the salt shaker
Improved sugar shaker so it only rotates, and emits sugar when it is being rotated and pointed down and to the left (proportionate to the amount of rotation)
# 0.00.07 (51915) May 13, 2011
Improved salt shaker so it uses acceleration and deceleration along its axis to determine how much salt comes out
Fixed: salt shaker should only translate up and down and side to side, not rotate
Fixed: salt shaker doesn't reset on reset all
Fixed: salt shaker should be in front
Fixed: conductivity tester doesn't appear in the new coordinate frame
Added tick marks and labels for beaker volume
Fixed: bar charts fill up too quickly
# 0.00.06 (51903) May 13, 2011

Improved the salt shaker
Show conductivity (and hence battery brightness) as linear with concentrations of salt ions
improved reset for conductivity tester and sugar dispenser
improved sugar pouring
improved user interaction for the sugar dispenser
5/9/11 Moved ConductivityTester and related strings and images from acid-base-solutions to piccolo-phet, see #2864
Fixed: Faucet shows fluid flow even when beaker is full

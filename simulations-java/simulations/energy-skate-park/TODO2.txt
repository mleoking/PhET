Questions:
• Is performance good enough during track friction > 0 case?  I removed duplicated computation in radius of curvature approximation.
	Removing this duplicated work resulted in substantial improvement (non-friction case = 10% processor, old friction case=30% processor, new fixed case=18% processor), but a difference in visible performance is still visible under a profiler.  Should I continue to investigate this issue?
	One performance optimization we can do for this simulation would be to cache values for points on the spline after user has stopped manipulating it (tradeoff processor usage for memory usage).  However, this would be nontrivial work, and I'm not sure it would pay off.  I would do a feasibility test to make sure enough track data can be cached at high enough resolution to make this effective.
• Add horizontal zoom for Energy vs. Time plot?

To Do:
• 7-10-2007: During both the interview on Thursday and the one I did the week before, the simulation froze after about 30 minutes or so of use.  I haven't been able to reproduce this, but both times it happened when the E vs. time graph was open and the interviewee tried to close it.  Sam, I can talk to you more about this tomorrow if you want, since it may be easier to explain in person.
• 7-10-2007: During the interview I did on Thursday, the bar graph would not work.  I tried several times to have the interviewee push the Bar Graph button, but the bar graph never came up.  I haven't been able to reproduce this, either.
• 7-11-2007: In two of Mindy’s tests, Energy Skate Park track graphics became dissociated from underlying model.
• 7-18-2007: If you pause the simulation, and then bring up the bar graph, and then push play again, the bar graph will not work.
• Bug: in one run, EnergySkateParkSimulationPanel.dragSplineSurface( PInputEvent event, EnergySkateParkSpline spline )  threw an exception, getting a null graphic for model object
• Implement separate layers for time series graph (currently different series are interleaved).  How long would this take?
    To implement this without substantial loss of performance, path segments should be drawn that are longer than 1/2 the stroke width.
    This means instead of painting just the most recent data point, the last N data points should be drawn, where N is a function of the stroke width.
    Also, to maintain high performance, the last N data points should be drawn using optimized code (not the same code that draws single points).
    There will be slight (a few percent) performance degradation for this layered representation.
    I expect it will take around 2 hours to implement and test this.
• Add Spanish translation.
• Better mountain graphics?
• Fix listener leaks (maybe fixed)
• When I open the Energy vs Position graph, the performance rapidly decreases.
    -On my machine, it is approx 25% processor usage without this E vs X graph, 40% with.
• Playback cursor (on E vs. T graph) is completely opaque on mac, I think a different buffered image type (or colormodel?) is necessary on mac
• Bug: In one run, there is a floor in space (may be solved)
• Out of memory error after recording lots of complicated states, loading lots of images and setting charts to very large.
• Performance is terrible during playback on other planets.
• On a track with high-friction, near the bottom of a local minimum, the skater gained energy and sped off.
    -I have had trouble reproducing this.
    -Played with this for quite awhile and kept friction on, changed tracks, visited different planets etc.. and could not reproduce it. (version 2.02)
• When I zoom the E vs P graph, it clears
• If you have checked PE reference and then Reset. The check mark stays, but the reference line is hid.

Interview Questions:
• Should PE=0 line be visible in space?
• Should pie chart disappear when going underneath PE=0 (even when oscillating)?

Maybe:
• Support for undo?
• Skater location is not correctly saved in File->Save (if on track)
• Track can become dissociated from mouse during drag after proposed match.
• Bug: The dragging constraints are not skater-centric; after dragging against a constraint, the mouse is no longer directly over the skater.
• Save skater character as part of a saved state? (30 min or so)
• Performance problems after lots of runs?
• Allow user to save a "batch" of experiments, and switch between them.
• gradient for earth in energyskate park sim (see projectile motion)
    -Simple solution would degrade performance, more complicated solution would take up to an hour
• Improve performance e.g. during right-click interaction with track
• Energy conservation (wait until we see visible problem)
• Skater should point at track while dragging: Unpredictable behavior when there are 2+ possible matches.
• Mystery planet where they would have to figure out the acceleration due to gravity?
        With a Mystery Planet, we'd want to remove other features from the simulation (readout of gravity on the slider), etc.
        Maybe we shouldn't implement this until we have decided on the activity, what the user should be able to do, what measurements she will be able to take, etc...
• Crashing skater?
• Add game-ish modes
	. 2-skater mode
	. Grab the apple?
	. Jump the buses?
• Another thing I was wondering was if the dots had a fixed time spacing, and if so what was it.
• Would it take much time to have a right click on the character bring up the character choices?
• "Bring back the skater" button broken sometimes (mac problem?) (could be resolved in 2.01.07)

Postponed:
• Zoom out button on mac chopped off right 1/4 due to resize handles on window.
• Add rotation for skater in the air.
• Add visualization for force diagram (or just normal force?)
• With high enough speed, sometimes the skater can pass through a track (or ground)
• Mouse and spline control point can become separated from each other.
• Performance problem when all charts open with complicated track.
    -I have trouble reproducing this problem (perhaps you could email me a track that exhibits this problem?)  Also not sure how much time should be spent solving the situation with 3 charts and a complicated track.
• Part of grid is disappearing when pie chart disappears (low priority)

Double check:
Moving the energy zero point while paused doesn't update pie chart or bar chart
